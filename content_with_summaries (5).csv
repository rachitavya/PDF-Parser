tenure of Kisan Credit Card, i.e., five years. (**Illustration I**) 
 
 
5.1.3 
For cultivating more than one crop in a year 
 The limit is to be fixed as above depending upon the crops cultivated as per proposed cropping pattern for the first year plus an additional 10% of the limit towards cost escalation / increase in scale of finance for every successive year (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year).

Term loan for investment 
The term loan for investment is to be made towards land development, minor irrigation, purchase of farm equipment and allied agricultural activities. The banks may fix the quantum of credit for term and working capital limit for agricultural and allied activities, etc., based on the unit cost of the asset/s proposed to be acquired by the farmer, the allied activities already being undertaken on the farm, the bank's judgment on repayment capacity vis-a-vis total loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations.

Fixation of Sub-limits  
i. Short term loans and term loans are governed by different interest rates. At present, short term crop loans upto ₹ 3 lakh are covered under Interest Subvention Scheme/Prompt Repayment Incentive scheme of the Government 
of India2. Further, repayment schedule and norms are different for short term 
and term loans. Hence, in order to have operational and accounting convenience, the card limit is to be bifurcated into separate sub-limits for short term cash credit limit cum savings account and *term loans*. 
ii. *Drawing limit* for short term cash credit should be fixed based on the 
cropping pattern. The amount(s) for crop production, repair and maintenance of farm assets and consumption may be allowed to be drawn as per the convenience of the farmer. In case the revision of scale of finance for any year by the district level technical committee exceeds the notional hike of 10% contemplated while fixing the five year limit, a revised drawable limit may be fixed in consultation with the farmer. In case such revisions require the card limit itself to be enhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the farmer be so advised.  
iii. For term loans, installments may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the nature of investment and repayment schedule drawn as per the economic life of the proposed investments. It is to be ensured that at any point of time the total liability should be **within the drawing limit of the concerned year**.

When cultivating more than one crop, the limit is based on the proposed cropping pattern for the first year, with an additional 10% for each successive year. Term loans for investment cover land development, minor irrigation, farm equipment, and allied agricultural activities, based on the proposed investments and the bank's perception of the farmer's repayment capacity. The Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) is the short term loan limit for the 5th year plus the estimated long term loan requirement, treated as the Kisan Credit Card limit.

In India organic farming has been practiced since thousands of years. The great Indian civilization thrived on organic farming and it has been practiced in Indian agriculture since the Vedic period. The traditional Indian agriculture was completely organic though it was not termed so. The techniques used for ploughing the field, sowing the seeds, use of fertilizers; everything had organic sensibility. Indian farmers have an inherent understanding of how to work closely with the nature, because only 30% of India's total cultivable area is covered with fertilizers because of assured irrigation and the balance 70% of arable land is mainly rainfed with little or zero use of fertilizer.
Currently Indian agriculture is passing through a very critical phase.
On the one hand, it is bearing the responsibility of providing national as well as household food and nutritional security to its teeming millions in a scenario of plateau of genetic potential in all major crops and little improvement in productivity of vast tracts of rainfed/dryland areas constituting approximately 44.2% of net cultivated area.  Whereas, on the other hand, wide-spread occurrence of ill-effects of Green Revolution Technologies (GRTs) in all intensively cultivated irrigated areas, a backbone to national food security, is threatening the very sustainability of the agricultural production system and national food security. Thirdly, it has to share local as well as global responsibility to ensure environmental safety for human kind.
In this scenario, now the farmers are gradually shifting back to organic farming. India has some natural advantages over other countries regarding utility of organic farming. India has vast cultivated area which has remained free of chemical contamination. The large agricultural land is rainfed with zero or very less use of synthetic fertilizers thus can be converted to organic farming easily. Organic farming is useful for small farmers as it does not demand extensive inputs. The other reason behind the shift to organic farming is growing demand of organic food in domestic as well as international market.
Organic farming is an integrated system that benefits land, landholder and environment as well. It involves local human, natural resources and processes with respect to carrying capacity of ecology. By reducing dependence on chemical or synthetic inputs and creating more balanced nutrient and energy flow, it strengthens ecosystem resilience, increases food security and generates additional income for cultivators. Organic farming responds positively to all sustainable agriculture and rural development objectives and helps in retaining soil fertility to improve crop production and socio-economic conditions of the farmers.",,,Mustard,153,input/md/english\UGPs-Organic FarmingTechnologies and Strategies.pdf,para,,"Organic farming has been practiced in India for thousands of years, with traditional agriculture techniques being completely organic. Currently, Indian agriculture is facing challenges in providing food security and dealing with the ill-effects of Green Revolution Technologies.

Among cropping systems, maize (grain)-potato-okra system recorded maximum total productivity in terms of basmati rice equivalent yield (BREY)(317.0 q/ha) followed by maize (green cobs) - mustard + radish cropping system (109.7 q/ha). On mean basis, the integrated nutrient management produced noticeable higher BREY as compared to organic and inorganic means of nutrient supply(Fig. 1).
The economic analysis of different cropping systems (Fig. 2) across the nutrient management practices reveals that highest net returns (Rs. 177297/ha) were recorded under organic nutrient supply. Irrespective of nutrient management options, CS3 (Maize (grain)-potato-okra) recorded the highest system net returns.
Data on soil studies (0–45 cm soil depth) under different cropping systems and nutrient management practices (Table 3) reveals that across different cropping systems, SOC and available N, P and K in the soil under different management practices were recorded higher under organic followed by integrated and inorganic nutrient supply. Among the cropping systems no definite trend was observed.

The data from two years indicated that these practices had a positive impact on net returns and benefit-cost ratio. Overall, the study highlighted the potential benefits of using organic pest management practices and green manuring in agricultural systems."

It is evident from the mean data of soil properties (0-45 cm depth)
that there was no significant effect of cropping systems and pest management practice on the SOC and availability of N, P and K into soil. However, the available N, P, K and SOC in the soil were significantly increased with green manuring in comparison to summer ploughing(Table
8).
Among the cropping systems, the basmati rice-chickpea cropping system registered higher net returns than basmati rice-mustard system. Irrespective of cropping systems, green manuringnoted better net returns and B:C ratio as compared to summer ploughing. Treating the crops with bio pesticides has indicated much net higher returns than untreated plots (Table 9).",,,"FarmerProducerOrganisationsFrequentlyAskedQuestions(Faqs),1.29WhatAreTheDesignVariables/FactorsGoverningTheSizeOfOptimalSizeOfAPoEnsuringThatThePoWillBeSustainable?",522,input/md/english\FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The study found that cropping systems and pest management practices did not have a significant effect on soil properties, but green manuring led to increased availability of nutrients in the soil.

123,"A Producer Organisation (PO) is a legal entity formed by primary producers, viz. farmers, milk producers, fishermen, weavers, rural artisans, craftsmen. A PO can be a producer company, a cooperative society or any other legal form which provides for sharing of profits/benefits among the members. In some forms like producer companies, institutions of primary producers can also become member of PO. 1.2 
What is the need for PO? 
The main aim of PO is to ensure better income for the producers through an organization of their own.  Small producers do not have the volume individually (both inputs and produce) to get the benefit of economies of scale. Besides, in agricultural marketing, there is a long chain of intermediaries who very often work non-transparently leading to the situation where the producer receives only a small part of the value that the ultimate consumer pays. Through aggregation, the primary producers can avail the benefit of economies of scale. They will also have better bargaining power vis-à-vis the bulk buyers of produce and bulk suppliers of inputs. 1.3 
What is a ""Farmers Producer Organisation"" (FPO)? 
It is one type of PO where the members are farmers. Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) is providing support for promotion of FPOs. PO is a generic name for an organization of producers of any produce, e.g., agricultural, non-farm products, artisan products, etc. 1.4 
Can there be a PO for non-farmers? 
Yes. The PO is an organization of the primary producers. If the produce in question is a nonfarm item (for example, handloom or handicraft), then the PO will be that of non-farmers. The objective of the PO is to ensure better income realization to its members (who are producers) through aggregation and, if feasible, value addition. 1.5 
What are the essential features of a PO? 
a. It is formed by a group of producers for either farm or non-farm activities. b. It is a registered body and a legal entity. c. Producers are shareholders in the organization. d. It deals with business activities related to the primary produce/product. e. It works for the benefit of the member producers. f. A part of the profit is shared amongst the producers. g. Rest of the surplus is added to its owned funds for business expansion.",,,"FarmerProducerOrganisationsFrequentlyAskedQuestions(Faqs),3.20WhoAreBoardOfDirectors(Bod)?",17,input/md/english\FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"Producer Organisations (POs) are legal entities formed by primary producers to ensure better income through organization and sharing of profits.

Essential features of a PO include being a registered body, having producers as shareholders, dealing with business activities related to the primary produce, and working for the benefit of member producers.

The office bearers play a crucial role in decision-making, financial management, and overall functioning of the FPO. Their responsibilities also include maintaining transparency, accountability, and good governance within the FPO."
127,"The ownership of the PO is with its members. It is an organization of the producers, by the producers and for the producers. One or more institutions and/or individuals may have promoted the PO by way of assisting in mobilization, registration, business planning and operations. However, ownership control is always with members and management is through the representatives of the members.",,,"FarmerProducerOrganisationsFrequentlyAskedQuestions(Faqs),3.22HowToBecomeAMemberOfAProducerCompany?",23,input/md/english\FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) is owned by its members and is for the producers.

In brief, the PO could undertake the following activities: 
a. Procurement of inputs b. Disseminating market information c. Dissemination of technology and innovations d. Facilitating finance for inputs e. Aggregation and storage of produce f.

162,"A PO will support the members in getting more income by undertaking any/many/all of the activities listed under point 1.14 above. By aggregating the demand for inputs, the PO can buy in bulk, thus procuring at cheaper price compared to individual purchase. Besides, by transporting in bulk, cost of transportation is reduced. Thus reducing the overall cost of production. Similarly, the PO may aggregate the produce of all members and market in bulk, thus, fetching better price per unit of produce. The PO can also provide market information to the producers to enable them hold on to their produce till the market price become favourable. All these interventions will result in more income to the primary producers. 1.16 
What are other benefits for the members of a PO (other than better income)? 
A PO is a collective of farmers (and non-farmers) who are the primary producers of a product (an agricultural produce or a manufactured product). It, therefore, can work as a platform to facilitate better access to government services, like PDS, MNREGA, Scholarships and Pensions, etc. It can liaison with the Government Departments for convergence of programmes, like drinking water, sanitation, health and hygiene. 1.17 
Who can become member of a PO? 
PO is an organization of the producers, specifically the primary producers. All primary producers residing in the relevant geography, and producing the same or similar produce, for which the PO has been formed, can become member of the PO. Membership is voluntary. The procedure for obtaining PO membership depends on the bye-laws of the PO. The founder-members are those who were there at the time of formation of the PO. Other members join the PO later. However, all members enjoy equal rights. A primary producer can become member of a PO by submitting an application and a nominal membership fee. Some POs also charge annual membership renewal fee. Although primary producers obtain membership of PO voluntarily, the promoting institution should make efforts to bring all producers into the PO, especially the small producers. 1.18 
Who is a primary producer? 
 Any person engaged in any activity connected with or related to any primary produce will be treated as producer. Primary produce means the produce of farmers from agriculture and allied activities or produce of persons engaged in handloom, handicrafts and other cottage industries, including any by-product and product resulting from ancillary activities thereof. Primary produce also includes any activity intended to increase the production or quality of aforementioned products or activities. Persons engaged in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fishery, sericulture, apiary, handloom, handicrafts, etc., can become members of appropriate PO. Persons engaged in collection of minor forest produce are also eligible for membership of PO although they gather these from forests and strictly are not producers. 1.19 
Can a person become member of more than one PO? 
 Family is the unit of production in rural areas. Benefits from the PO will accrue to members in proportion to the volume/value of produce given to the PO. Therefore, one person from a family can provide the whole produce of the family to the PO and get the same amount of benefit as multiple members providing the same volume/value. If however there are two different POs in the vicinity, each for a different type of produce, say vegetables and milk, one person can become member of both these POs, if the family produces both milk and vegetables.",,,"FarmerProducerOrganisationsFrequentlyAskedQuestions(Faqs),3.42ProvideDetailsOfAFewInstitutesPromotingTheEstablishmentAndManagementOfTheProducerCompanies?TheEstablishmentAndTheManagementOfTheProducerCompaniesAreUndertakenByVariousInstitutionsAsIndicatedBelow:",100,input/md/english\FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,table,,"Various institutions promote the establishment and management of producer companies to support members in increasing their income through activities like bulk procurement and marketing, reducing production costs, and providing market information.

A primary producer is defined as a person engaged in activities related to primary produce, including agriculture, handloom, handicrafts, and other cottage industries.

165,"Each PO will have an elected Board of Management / Board of Directors as per the bye-laws. The Board can engage professionals to manage its affairs. In the initial years, professional and managerial assistance is usually extended by the POPI. As the leaders of the PO gain experience, they should take over the affairs of the PO completely. 1.21 
Can a PO engage professionals to manage its business? 
All legal forms provide for engaging professional and other employees by the PO. Such persons should be paid out of the income of the PO. As far as possible, the income should come from value addition to the produce and not from price paid to members. If members get price less than the market, they will gradually move away from the PO. The professionals and other employees should be paid at par with the prevailing market to ensure that they remain for long with the PO. Compensation will also depend upon the business plan, ensuring a positive surplus. 1.22 
Can a PO procure produce from non-members? 
The objective of the PO is to ensure better income to the member-producers through aggregation and value addition. Therefore, procurement from non-members is usually not undertaken. However, market exigencies at times may necessitate such procurement. There should be provision in the by-laws of a PO to enable procurement from non-members during such exigencies. 1.23 
Can a PO sell the produce in the commodity exchanges? 
Yes, it can. The PO can aggregate the produce of its members, and sell it using the commodity exchanges. The produce needs to meet the quality standards specified by the commodity exchanges, and be stored scientifically in approved warehouses. The PO can become a member of the Commodity Exchanges to do trading directly, or else it can sell through the exchange-approved brokers. 1.24 
Can a PO export the produce of its members? 
Yes, it can. For exporting agricultural produce, all the members will have to follow Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). There are also other specific quality parameters that the importing countries impose for different produce which need to be complied with. For non-farm produce (handloom, handicrafts etc.), there are other quality specifications and other stipulations against using child labour, etc. 1.25 
How much expenses will be incurred for registration of a PO? 
Expenditure towards registration fee, stamp duty, preparation of documents and facilitation charges etc., will depend on the legal structure of the PO. In general, establishment of a producer company is more expensive than other legal forms.

181,"a. It is desirable to have a Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) for farmers having their 
lands in contiguous micro-watersheds to address the issues relating to sustainability. 
b. The productive land under an FPO may be around 4000 ha. 
c. The PO may cover generally one or two contiguous Gram Panchayats for ease of 
management.  
d. The number of farmer producers that need to be covered may be around 700 to 1000. e. The cost of managing a Producer Organisation of the above nature may be around Rs. 
2 lakh per month or Rs. 24 lakh per annum. 
f. The total value of the produce of the farmers/non-farmers handled by the Producer 
Organisation may be around Rs. 2.5 crore, assuming that approximately 10% of the total turnover of the PO may be reasonably spent towards cost of management.  
g. Further, the markets selected for the Producer Organisation for selling their produce

185,"a. A Farmers Producer Organisation is to be designed in such a way to cover all the lands 
that fall in one or two micro watersheds. 
b. The sustainability of the farmers of the micro watersheds is already in existence with 
various types of productive activities of the farmers to take care of risk factors, like variations in the market prices of various produce, continuity of income etc. which include sustainable agricultural practices.   
c. The secret to sustainability of a PO depends on comprehensive engagement of the PO 
with their members throughout the year. 
d. The design variables for a PO are mainly size, scope, technology, ownership of 
resources, management and purpose.  These variables need to be aligned to meet the sustainability requirements indicated in the earlier two points.   
e. The size of the PO should be small to be able to be managed by the local talent 
available in the area of the PO. 
f. The scope of the PO should be defined in such a way that there shall be good number 
of crops to be grown to maintain the soil health, support for allied activities like dairy, nutritional security of the local people and to mitigate risk. 
g. The technology adopted by the PO should be such that majority of the local people or 
members of the families of the PO should be able to adopt to it and work with it with minimal training, effectively. 
h. The management of the PO should take into account the incubation of the local youth 
in such a way that in a few years' time, say in 3-7 years, local youth should be able to take over and manage the PO effectively. 
i. The purpose of the PO at all times must be to serve the larger needs of the community 
and the ownership of the PO always should rest with all its members. 
1.30 What should be the minimum and maximum number of members in a PO? The minimum number of membership depends on the legal form of the PO. For example, 10 or more primary producers can incorporate a Producer Company under Section 581(C) of Indian Companies Act 1956 (same provisions are retained in the 2013 Act). There is no restriction on the maximum number of membership. Generally, the PO will require certain minimum scale of operation to remain in business. This operation scale/volume is known as break-even level. Studies have shown that a PO will require about 700 to 1000 active producers as members for sustainable operation. 1.31 Who can become a Producer Organisation Promoting Institution (POPI)? An NGO, a bank branch, a Government Department, a Cooperative Society or any Association or Federation can become a POPI. Basically, the POPI needs to be a legal entity so that it can enter into legally valid contracts with other institutions including the PO which they seek to promote. Support is available for POPIs from SFAC and NABARD for meeting part of the recurring cost incurred for promotion of the PO based on individual project considerations.

The size, scope, technology, ownership of resources, management, and purpose of the PO should be carefully considered to meet sustainability needs. The minimum number of members for a PO depends on the legal form, while there is no restriction on the maximum number of members. Studies suggest that a PO will require about 700 to 1000 active producers as members for sustainable operation.

It has been observed that PACS are generally meeting the credit requirements of its members. However, there is a need to provide other services to the farmers and hence, PACS should be developed as a unit to meet all their needs. PACS are generally providing the following facilities to the members: 
i. 
Input facilities in form of cash or kind component to members 
ii. 
Agriculture implements on hiring basis 
iii. 
Storage facility 
PACS can play an important role in providing these facilities to the farmers.  In order to enable PACS to provide more services to its members and generate income, an initiative was taken to develop PACS as multi service centres.  Some of the PACS are also assisting farmers in marketing of their produce. Thus, PACS can provide both backward and forward linkages to its members, thereby acting as a PO, in order to promote efficient crop production practices for its members on one hand and opportunities for better price realisation of their produce, on the other.  Following facilities can be taken up by PACS acting as a PO to the farmers: 
a) **Agro-Storage centre:** 
a. Upgradation of the existing storage facility or construction of new godown 
along with sorting/ grading unit as per Negotiable Warehouse Receipt System. This will enable them to issue warehouse receipts. Based on these receipts, the farmers can get loan against the crop stored and can cultivate the next crop. Thus, the farmers will be facilitated to get better price by holding the crops without affecting the fund flow position. 
b) **Agro-service Centre:** 
a. Purchase of hi-tech agri-implements like power tiller, land leveller, rotary 
slasher, movers, seed driller, multi crop planter, paddy transplanter, sprayers, combine harvester etc. depending upon the requirements of members. The earning will be from the rental of these equipment. 
c) **Agro-processing centre:**  
a. Primary Processing: Sorting, grading unit, waxing/ polishing unit, pre-cooling 
chambers, etc. 
b. Secondary Processing: Value addition to produce e.g. Mini rice mill, atta chaki, 
horticulture produce processing etc. 
d) **Agri -information centre :** 
a. Testing lab for soil & water, creating panel of experts for providing services on 
payment basis, knowledge dissemination centre, arrange training to farmers. The testing lab & expert guidance will be available to farmers at a cost. 
e) **Agri Transportation & Marketing Facilities :**

11,"7.1 What is the concept of value chain development? 
Value chain comprises all the activities at different yet interlinked stages that add value to a particular product through the different phases of production, including procurement of raw materials and other inputs. Usually, there are many actors along the value chain for producing, transforming/processing and bringing goods and services to end-consumers through a series of sequential activities. When the produce originates from agriculture, we call it an agricultural value chain. Let us take the case of milk. For producing milk, the farmer requires milch cattle, feed and fodder and shed for the cattle. After milking (once/twice a day), the milk is taken to the collection centre where the volume, fat and SNF contents are measured. From the collection centre, milk is transported to the Bulk Milk Chilling Unit, where the milk is filtered and chilled to keep it fresh. From there, it goes to Milk Processing Plant, where bacteria is de-activated through pasteurization, and different types of milk and milk products are made. Liquid milk (whole milk, toned milk, vitamin-A fortified milk) is made into packets and sent to wholesalers. The retailers get milk packets from the wholesalers and sell to the consumers through milk booth and/or through door delivery. Processed milk products like butter, curd, cheese, ghee etc., also reach the end-consumers from the processing facility thorough the same channel. The whole chain from purchasing of milch cattle to delivery of milk packets to consumers is the value chain for milk. Though value is added at each stage, major addition takes place through Milk Chilling, Pasteurisation and Processing. All the persons/agencies undertaking one or more activities in this chain are called the actors in the value chain.",,,"DepartmentOfAgriculture,Cooperation&Farmers'Welfare(Dac&Fw),1.Scheme",34,input/md/english\RevisedPM-KISANOperationalGuidelines(English).pdf,para,,"The concept of value chain development involves all activities that add value to a product through different stages of production.

Using the example of milk production, the value chain includes activities such as measuring volume and fat content, transportation to chilling units, pasteurization, and distribution to wholesalers and retailers. The major value addition in this chain occurs during milk chilling, pasteurization, and processing. All individuals or entities involved in these activities are considered actors in the value chain."

15,"7.2 What is value chain intervention? 
The PO may choose to undertake any one or more than one activity of the value chain. In the example above, the PO may manufacture/procure concentrate feed and supply it to the farmers. It can purchase milch cattle in bulk from outside the state for the members. It can establish Bulk Milk Chilling Unit or Milk Processing Plant. It can purchase refrigerated vans for transport of milk and milk products.  It can establish milk parlours to sell milk and milk products to the end-consumers. Any such activity will be a value chain intervention. The key is to choose the intervention where the value-addition (and therefore the margin) is high, and which can be effectively managed by the PO keeping in view competition in the market.",,,"DepartmentOfAgriculture,Cooperation&Farmers'Welfare(Dac&Fw),5.MethodologyForCalculationOfBenefit",1340,input/md/english\RevisedPM-KISANOperationalGuidelines(English).pdf,para,,"The PO may choose to undertake various activities of the value chain, such as manufacturing/procuring concentrate feed, purchasing milch cattle in bulk, establishing Bulk Milk Chilling Unit or Milk Processing Plant, purchasing refrigerated vans for transport, and establishing milk parlours.

 7.4 What is a business plan? Business plan is a succinct document that specifies the components of a strategy with regard to the business mission, external and internal environments and problems identified in earlier analysis. A business plan is not written each time a modification to a strategy is made. It should be written when a new venture is developed or a major new initiative is launched. Sincere contemplation is needed about the business concept, the business opportunity, the competitive landscape, the essential elements for success, and the people who will be involved. The exercise will often lead to more questions, and these new questions must be properly researched to gain deep insight into the issues and challenges that lie ahead. In short, the business plan must contain answers to the questions 
""Who/What/Where/When/Why/How/How Much"". 7.5 What is business planning? The business planning process starts with Generation of Business Ideas, followed by Opportunities & Threats Analysis leading to Identification of suitable Business Opportunities.

23,"7.6 Why should a PO prepare a business plan? Every business irrespective of size needs planning. Business planning is essential for growth and sustainability. It provides broad ideas to meet the expected and unexpected opportunities and obstacles the future holds. In case of a PO, it is all the more essential since most of the members will be acting as businessmen for the first time. A business plan helps the PO in the following ways: 
a. It helps in examining viability of the venture in a particular market. b. It provides guidance to the PO for organising and planning activities. c. It serves as an important tool in accessing finance/funding. If the financier is 
comfortable with the business plan, the PO will be asked to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR).",,,"DepartmentOfAgriculture,Cooperation&Farmers'Welfare(Dac&Fw),9.3Pm-KisanPortal:",11,input/md/english\RevisedPM-KISANOperationalGuidelines(English).pdf,para,,"POs should prepare a business plan for viability, guidance, and funding.

7.8 What is included in an executive summary? The executive summary is an abstract containing the important points of the business plan. Its purpose is to communicate the plan in a convincing way to important audiences, such as potential investors, so they will read further. It may be the only chapter of the business plan a reader uses to make a quick decision on the proposal. As such, it should fulfill the reader's (financier's) expectations. It is prepared after the total plan has been written. The executive summary should describe the following: 
a. The industry and market environment in which the opportunity will develop and 
flourish  
b. The special and unique business opportunity—the problem the product or service will 
be solving  
c. The strategies for success—what differentiates the product or service from the

 7.9 What is included in a Business Description? The business description explains the business concept by giving a brief yet informative picture of the history, the basic nature, and the purpose of the business, including business objectives and why the business will be successful. The purposes of the business description are to: 
a. Express clearly  understanding of the business concept  
b. Share enthusiasm for the venture  
c. Meet the expectations of the reader by providing a realistic picture of the business 
venture  
 7.10 What is Industry Analysis? Understanding the industry, the competition, and the market in which the business will operate is fundamental to the business plan.

a. Provide thorough understanding of the business environment  
b. Guide in developing an effective marketing plan c. Persuade the readers of business plan of the realistic potential of the venture d. What special technology, innovation, new perspective, or unique concept will the 
business offer to the customer? 
 7.11 What is Marketing Plan? The marketing plan describes how the product will be sold, how the business will motivate the customer to buy. The purpose of developing and including the marketing plan in the business plan is twofold:  
a. The process of designing a coherent marketing plan, that is an integral part of the 
overall business plan, will help the business to test ideas, explore options, and determine effective strategies for success.

 7.14 How do you choose a marketing strategy? After choosing the market segment that the PO wishes to target and having carried out the SWOT analysis, the suitable marketing strategy should be chosen. The choice depends on a variety of factors including the image that the PO wants to project about the product and the organization, its sales objectives like whether it wants rapid penetration or is content with slow penetration of the market etc. The PO may choose one or more combinations of strategy, but needs to strategically plan a right mix of the 4 Ps (Product, Price, Place & Promotion - called the Marketing Mix) to develop an appropriate marketing strategy. 7.15 What is Operations Plan? Operations is the work (activity) of the business. It is transforming of the raw materials into products to be sold to the customer. The operations plan gives an overview of the flow of the daily activities of the business and the strategies that support them. The main purpose of the operations plan section is to show that the business is focused on the critical operating factors that will make it successful. It should contain the critical success factors affecting how the business creates value for the stakeholders of the business, and the breakeven point. 7.16 What is break-even point? It is that volume of operation of the business at which unit sales equals operating costs. The breakeven point determines how many units of the product must be sold to break even, to cover the cost of production. It is the point at which the business will have no profit, no loss. 
 
7.17 What is Financial Plan? The financial plan translates all the other parts of the business - the opportunity, the operating plan, the marketing plan, the management team—into anticipated financial results. It contains the current status and the future projection of financial performance of the business. The financial plan represents the best estimates of the risks involved, and the return on investment. Three financial areas are generally discussed in the financial plan: 
a. Capital requirement and financing pattern b. Financial projections including cash flow statement c. Financial returns (Return on Investment, Internal Rate of Return, Net Present Value) 
 7.18 What is a 'Budget'? A budget is a forecast of all cash sources and deployments. Budgets help to determine how much money one has or can access, where to use it, and whether the financial targets will be achieved. It shows the flow of money into, through and out of the business. The three basic elements of a budget are: 
a. Sales revenue b. Costs c. Profits",,,"DepartmentOfAgriculture,Cooperation&Farmers'Welfare(Dac&Fw),10ModalitiesForTransferOfBenefit",502,input/md/english\RevisedPM-KISANOperationalGuidelines(English).pdf,para,,"The marketing strategy should be chosen based on factors like the desired product and organizational image, sales objectives, and market penetration goals.

35,"a. The idea can be a solution to a problem experienced by primary producers. For 
instance, collective sale of agricultural produce to the bigger market will reduce the role of middlemen and ensure better price to producers. Collective purchase of agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc., and selling them to the producers reduces per unit cost while ensuring quality of the inputs. 
b. It can be for use of new technology or material to meet a widely felt need. An idea of 
creating an agro service center for hiring tractor, power-tiller, transplanter, harvester, thresher etc., on rental basis to the small farmers can reduce cost of production besides increasing productivity. Similarly, establishing a Bulk Milk Chilling Unit for milk producers can be a good business idea. 
c. It can be for establishing an Agri-Clinic for providing fee-based extension services. 
 7.20 How do you identify business opportunities and threats? Once a few business ideas are generated, each idea must be critically evaluated with respect to the external business environment for identifying the business opportunity and threats. Every idea must be evaluated to know whether it is worth pursuing. The opportunities and threats of each ideas are analysed in terms of the following attributes: 
a. Size of the market 
b. Its stability i.e., the demand for the product long term or purely temporary? c. The extent to which the market is dissatisfied with the existing solution d. Level of competition, high, medium or low e. Price and quality sensitivity of the market 
f. 
Barriers to entry/exit 
g. Changes in government's policies such as subsidy, availability of low cost funds, etc. 
7.21 How do you identify the risks and provide safeguards? Identification of risks and possible safeguards is an integral part of the Opportunity/Threat analysis. The goal is not to eliminate risk altogether (an impossible proposition) but to identify them and assess whether they can be managed or minimised through operational resilience. If the risks or threats seem unmanageable then one may discard the business idea all together. Even after starting the business, the risks continue to remain in the business environment, internally and externally both. Hence, it is important to develop risk assessment mechanism and risk mitigation strategy. There are five key steps in the development of this strategy. 
a. The first step is to identify and map the processes/factors that would have the biggest 
impact on earnings, if disrupted. For example, bad monsoon will severely affect crop production in rain-fed areas thus reducing earning of the PO considerably. 
b. The second step is to identify critical infrastructure —including processes, 
relationships, people, regulations, plant, and equipment—that supports the PO's ability to generate earnings. For example, if there is break-down in the Bulk Milk Chilling Unit, the whole stock of milk will be spoilt and go waste, besides adversely affecting the supply chain.  
c. The third step is to identify the main vulnerabilities. Vulnerability is inability to cope 
with the adverse effects of an event or risk. For example, storage, processing and trading of commodities can come under new regulation, imposing conditions, which the PO may find difficult to comply with, at short notice.  
d. The fourth step is to identify the weakest links, the elements on which all the others 
depend. For example, if there is a single buyer for all produces, this is the weakest link.  
e. The last step is to develop planned response to mitigate the risks. For example, the 
enterprise may build redundancies in some critical infrastructure like a spare refrigerated van for ferrying chilled milk.   
 7.22 What support is available from government departments for market linkage? Many State Governments have schemes for preferential procurement of produce from POs. For example, procurement of certified seeds through POs has been implemented by the Government of Chhattisgarh. The facilitating agency should be able to get the relevant information from the respective Governments. 7.23 What support is available from corporates for market linkage? The corporates need continuous supply of desired quality produce for processing and value addition. Therefore, they prefer to enter into contract with few producer organisations who will meet their requirement. Usually the following mechanisms are adopted: 
a. Retail chains tie up with POs for procurement. b. Corporates extend dealership for farm machinery and inputs to POs. c. Corporates provide primary processing machinery to PO with buy-back arrangement 
for the produce",,,"DepartmentOfAgriculture,Cooperation&Farmers'Welfare(Dac&Fw),B.UnionGovernment:",224,input/md/english\RevisedPM-KISANOperationalGuidelines(English).pdf,para,,"The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers' Welfare aims to address issues faced by primary producers through collective sale of agricultural produce and purchase of inputs. It also encourages the use of new technology and materials to meet agricultural needs, such as establishing agro service centers and Bulk Milk Chilling Units.

Risks are identified and safeguards are provided to manage or minimize them, with a focus on developing a risk assessment mechanism and mitigation strategy. Government departments offer support for market linkage through schemes for preferential procurement of produce from Producer Organisations (POs), while corporates seek continuous supply of quality produce and may enter into contracts with POs for procurement and provision of machinery."

29,"a. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a process control system designed 
to identify and prevent microbial and other hazards in food production.  It includes steps designed to prevent problems before they occur and to correct deviations as soon as they are detected.  Such preventive control system with documentation and verification are 
widely recognized by scientific authorities and international organizations as the most effective approach available for producing safe food. 
b. HACCP involves a system approach to identification of hazard, assessment of chances of 
occurrence of hazards during each phase, raw material procurement, manufacturing, distribution, usage of food products, and in defining the measures for hazard control.  In doing so, the many drawbacks prevalent in the inspection approach are prevented and HACCP overcomes shortcomings of reliance only on microbial testing. 
c. HACCP enables the producers, processors, distributors, exporters, etc., of food products 
to utilize technical resources efficiently and in a cost effective manner in assuring food safety.  Food inspection too would be more systematic and therefore hassle-free.  It would no doubt involve deployment of some additional finances initially but this would be more than compensated in the long run through consistently better quality and hence better prices and returns.",,,7.3**DutiesAndResponsibilitiesOfCbbos:**,473,input/md/english\FPO_Scheme_Guidelines_FINAL_English.pdf,para,,"Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a preventive control system recognized as the most effective approach for producing safe food.

Banks review and reassess the working capital requirements of borrowing enterprises regularly using methods like Cash Budget System, Turnover Method, Maximum Permissible Bank Finance (MPBF) System, and Net Owned Funds System. Cash budgeting is done for a year, with month to month cash flows being analyzed using information like balance sheets, projected profit and loss accounts, estimates of monthly sales, purchases, expenses, and incomes. The cash flow is computed by considering cash inflow and outflow, including opening cash/bank balance, sales, receivables, payments for raw materials, consumables, creditors, fixed assets, taxes, interest, labor payments, and other expenses.

130,"The difference between inflow and outflows of cash would clearly indicate period when the business is short of cash and to what extent it requires funding. There would be variations in the cash deficit from month to month. The peak level of cash deficit would be the outer limit of working capital requirements. A two track working capital limit, one at the base level taking care of the normal requirements over the year and another additional limit to take care of increased seasonal demands, is worked out. B. Projected Annual Turnover (PAT): The working capital credit limits provided by lending banks is at a minimum level of 20% of the Projected Annual Turnover (PAT). This norm is applicable in case of units (new as well as existing), village and tiny units with aggregate fund based 'working capital credit limits up to Rs.5 Crore from the banking system. The term PAT is with Gross Sales and not Net Sales.  
a. The lending norms presuppose that the working capital requirements of a unit 
may be considered as 25% of the value of output or PAT. Banks normally 
provide 4/5th  or 80% of this amount, the residual portion to be brought in by 
the promoter by way of margin from long term sources. The working capital credit limits provided by banks is at a minimum level of 20% of the projected annual turnover.  
b. The total working capital requirements of a unit, pegged at 25% of PAT, 
assumes an average working capital cycle of 3 months. In reality though, different units with different activities have different working capital cycle patterns at levels higher and lower than the average cycle of 3 months.  It is therefore, necessary that the permissible level of bank credit is also assessed by using other methods of appraisal as applicable in each case along with the PAT based appraisal of credit requirements for units.",,,*ListOfMandatoryDocumentsToBeAttachedWithTheApplicationForm,248,input/md/english\FPO_Scheme_Guidelines_FINAL_English.pdf,para,,"The difference between inflow and outflows of cash indicates cash shortages and funding needs.

10,"a. **Own Resources:** The reserve and surpluses of previous years are the source for 
personal financing. However, in case of a new PC this opportunity will not be there. 
b. **Suppliers' Credit and Advance Payment from Buyers:** Suppliers' Credit can be 
obtained from credit companies or from potential buyers and sellers. The producers who sell their products to the PO, can sell on credit. PO can get part payment in advance from prospective buyers. It can get agriculture inputs from the Agro dealers on the conditions of payment after sales. But mostly this type of finance is not available for start-up businesses or a new venture. 
c. **Equity**: In case of a PC the equity comes from the members and no external financier 
can participate in the equity investment.  
d. **Grant support:** The PC being a small holders' organization may seek capital support 
and other assistance from the Government under certain government schemes. Two 
major initiatives to support Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) (i) support to the equity base of FPOs by providing matching equity grants, and (ii) setting up of a Credit Guarantee Fund to provide cover to banks which advance loans to FPOs without collateral has been announced by GoI. The Schemes will be implemented by Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC). Details are given in Appendix ii. Funding may also be available from the Department of Rural Development and Panchayats, Ministries of Agriculture and Cooperation or Horticulture or Food Processing GoI and or state Governments under various schemes like National and State Horticulture Mission, Small Agribusiness Consortium. World Bank, bilateral/ multilateral donor agencies and corporates under CSR may be other possible source of funds/grants from Producer organisations. The POs will have to develop a financially viable business plans for the purpose 
 
e. **Debt financing:** This is the most preferred way of financing a new business. Here it is 
a direct obligation to pay the interest on the money lent by the financier. The biggest advantage is that the financier does not have control over the business as opposed to equity financing. The important point to be noted in this is the rate of interest charged. However, it is not easy to raise debt financing for a producers company without collateral and margin.",,,Abbreviations,100,input/md/english\Revised_Operational_Guidelines.pdf,table,,"The sources of financing for a Producer Company (PC) include own resources, suppliers' credit, advance payment from buyers, equity, grant support, and debt financing.

13,"The banks provide Short Term loan to meet working capital requirements and Medium to Long Term Loan for acquisition of capital assets (Term Loan) for any business. A composite loan to take care of both short and long term financial requirements loan is also sanctioned by Banks. The finance will depend on the nature and volume of business which would vary from case to case. The FPOs will have to approach the bank with a financially viable business plan/Detailed Project Report. The banks will generally require the following information/ data for sanction of loan; 
a. A business plan and Detailed Project Report (DPR) as a formal application for availing 
the credit support 
b. Margin money contribution c. Details of project management (Executive team and Board of Directors with 
qualification and experience) of PO 
d. Details of dedicated team for execution and monitoring of the project e. Details of proposed business plan f. Financial requirements for executing the business plan g. Last 3 years audited financial statements (Balance Sheet & P/L statement) with notes

9.12 What is Detailed Project Report (DPR)? A DPR is a formal application for availing the credit support from any funding agency. It should provide details about the organization, Business plan, Marketing Plan, Operation and Management Plan, Financial projections and financial requirements. Although there would be some NGOs and Producer Organizations that are experienced in preparing DPRs, typically a Producer Organization would require assistance in preparation of the DPR through experts/ professional, which may involve some cost.  
 
9.13 Is any support available for preparation of DPR? 
SFAC provides Project development Facility (PDF) for Equity Grant and Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for the preparation of Equity Grant Application and Detailed Project Reports (DPR) through empanelled consultants/institutions. SFAC will cover the full cost of preparation of DPR. This facility will be available for FPC only. FPC desirous of assistance may approach the nearest empanelled consultant or SFAC directly. In addition to three broad categories of support (i.e. credit support, capacity building & market linkage) under PODF, NABARD provides grant support for preparation of DPR up to 0.5% of the project cost or Rs. 1.0 lakh whichever is lower, subject to the fact that the project is sanctioned by NABARD. The grant assistance would be within the overall cap of 20% of the loan amount. 
 
9.14 If Banks do not provide credit facility, what are the options available for POs? A newly formed PO does not have enough share capital, reserves and credentials for doing successful business, therefore mobilizing funds from banks is difficult in the initial phase. With all the costs included, the PO may face huge financial burden from the beginning and the idea of setting up PO may not even take off.  To overcome the problem, the POs may adopt the following business model in the initial years before they generate reserves and establish credentials. 
a. Choose those activities in the initial years which require very less capital or no capital 
and which are risk free.  
b. Take Dealership of seeds and fertilizers from the companies and work as commission 
agents. POs can earn good margin and a business relationship with those companies which resulted in getting credit limit in the subsequent years.  
c. Dealership from various companies for various agriculture implements like water 
pump sets, mechanized plough, etc., which they can sell to their members at a reasonable price and earn commission.  
d. Procurement of agriculture produce. The POs identified the prospective buyers and 
arranged buy back guarantee from them. Sell was organized at the farm gate level, therefore no transportation and storage cost were involved at the PO level. PO ensured a transparent transaction between the buyers and sellers (members and nonmembers both) and by doing so they earned some margin from the buyers.  
e. Many POs took the advantage of GoI scheme, which provide 80% of the value of 
produce as loan against pledge of Warehouse Receipts (WHR) without collateral.  
 The successful demonstration of such business would build their credentials among the members and other stakeholders. Further, Demonstration of fair trade practices is very important for the PO. These small activities give POs the opportunity to demonstrate such practices. Both the members and the trade and industry with whom PO does the business appreciate such fair practices and it builds reputation for the PO.

161,"Monitoring can be defined as a systematic collection and analysis of information of an ongoing project. It is aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the project implementation so as to derive maximum benefits for the producers/PO. 10.2 
What is efficiency? 
Efficiency speaks about whether the output in terms of benefits exceed the expenditure. It is the ratio of output and input. Funding agency will monitor how efficient the POPI and PO has been in implementing the project. Similarly, the PO will monitor the same at the farmers 'producers' level. Certain parameters like the amount spent per farmer vis-a-vis the increase in income could be one indicator of efficiency. Higher the increase in income for the same amount spent, higher is the efficiency. 10.3 
What is effectiveness?  
Effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which the project achieved the specific objectives it set.   For example, if the objective of a project is to increase the income levels of all the farmers 'producers' engaged with the PO, we have to measure the extent of increase in income.  Similarly, if one of the objective is to increase the volume of the produce, we shall measure the extent of increase.   These assessments will indicate how effective the program has been. Higher the increase in income levels, higher would be the effectiveness of the project. 10.4 
Who will monitor the Project?  
The project is to be monitored by the PO, POPI and funding agency. 10.5 What is to be monitored by the PO? The PO has to satisfy itself that it is able to function in a sound manner for meeting the expectations of all the stakeholders. It also needs to monitor work execution at the producer level. The PO has to prepare a work schedule/time line in consultation with the POPI for procurement of inputs, execution of works, marketing of produce. Accordingly, at each stage, review and monitoring has to be done by the PO. The PO has to evolve suitable formats for collecting data for the purpose of review and monitoring. 10.6 What is to be monitored by the POPI? The POPI has to monitor the work of the PO as well as ground level achievements. It has to assess the extent of progress of the work from time to time and if required suggest suitable measures. It has to arrange to design specific formats and provide to the PO. The PO will collect data in the specified formats and submit to the POPI and to funding agency.  Besides the progress, the POPI should also monitor staff availability for the project, data on individual producer, cost involved, availability of inputs, volume of produce, income, verification of the books of the PO etc., and submit detailed report to the funding agency on the agreed intervals, say monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly. 10.7 
What is to be monitored by the Funding Agency: The funding agency has to evolve suitable formats for the submission of returns by PO/POPI. The funding agency has to monitor the targets vis-a-vis achievements, quality of implementation, participation of members and adequacy of training programmes. Monitoring enables the funding agency to determine whether the resources available are adequate and capacity of the human resources to implement the project is adequate.  Monitoring could be at desk level (office) or field level. 10.8  What is desk monitoring? Desk monitoring includes internal review of the project by the project funding agency. It is difficult for the funding agency or the POPI to conduct field visits at frequent intervals, hence based on the returns submitted by the agency, desk review of the progress could be done. The findings could be discussed in a forum where POs and POPIs can participate. Based on the discussions, bottlenecks in the implementation could be identified, discussed and remedial measures initiated. The POPI will undertake review based on both the reports submitted by the PO and its own staff involved in the field. The review may involve the participation of PO at agreed intervals, so as to improve the implementation of the project. At every level, i.e., at the level of funding agency, POPI and PO, suitable formats for submission of data and suitable templates for presentations need to be evolved. The returns to be submitted by the PO should include: 
a. Business projections/ assumptions submitted in proposal and comparison with 
actual progress 
b. Disbursements - Targets and achievements c. Repayments - Dues  and their repayment and overdue amount d. Operations of Designated Account; and Up-to-date correspondence with borrower e. Stock statements, annual report, latest balance sheet and P&L statements (If the 
review is after annual closing) 
f. Any pending compliance with terms and conditions 
After obtaining the returns POPI and funding agency should:   
a. Review progress b. Identify problems in planning and/or implementation c. If required make adjustments in release of funds to producers organization 
 10.9 
 Whether the desk level monitoring gives any 'Early Warning Signals'? What are they? One of the objectives of desk monitoring is to identify the 'Early Warning Signals'. There could be deviation in the implementation plan, violation of terms and conditions, shortfall in achievement, overdue amounts at the level of PO, operation of designated accounts, inadequacy of suitable  field staff, reduced participation of PO or POPI or the producers, which are to be closely monitored and if required, an immediate field level monitoring needs to be taken up. 
 
10.10 What is Field Level Monitoring? Field level monitoring involves collection of actual data at the field level. It involves collection of 'elaborate' data from the field level by interacting with the farmers/producers and other stake holders. Specific proforma on the pattern of the format suggested in Chapter 9 could be evolved for collection of data or depending upon the requirement suitable proforma need to be designed for collection of data. Often, field level monitoring data on the following aspects is also important as these factors provide leads to the success or failure of the project: 
a. Availability of inputs to members - timeliness b. Technical support available to members - targeted Vs. actual frequency c. Storage and processing arrangement - planned Vs. achievement 
d. Marketing tie-up - planned benefits Vs. actual benefits e. Targeted Productivity / Income growth Vs. Actual achievements f. Members views regarding the services provided by PO and its efficacy 
 10.11 How to Plan Monitoring of Projects? Monitoring should be a part of planning process.  It is desirable to frame monitoring parameters in the beginning of planning process itself. These parameters should be in line with the objectives of the project. Therefore, the funding agency, POPI and the PO have to begin gathering information about performance in relation to targets from the beginning itself.  In fact, the first information gathering should take place when the project is planned. 10.12  What indicators can we suggest? Indicators are measurable or tangible signs that the project or the PO has to achieve.  For example, some indicators are increase in productivity, production, income at the level of producers, improvement in the economy of the area leading to establishment of micro enterprises, increase in employment opportunities, community empowerment in terms of arresting migration, improvement in health and hygiene, infrastructure, women participation, women empowerment etc.  Through the indicators one can ask and answer questions such as: Who? - Who are befitting from the project? How many? - Number of people benefitted. How much? - What is the extent of benefit? Some examples of Indicators could be as follows: Please note that these are illustrative and are related to agriculture projects - they may or may not suit the needs of other Non-farm based projects.

a. To improve the producer's income b. To develop the area under agriculture c. To arrest migration d. To improve marketing facilities e. To bring change in the quality of lives of the people f. To create awareness on sustainability of natural resources g. To improve the participation of women in the developmental process to address

When developing indicators for the project, objectives such as improving producer's income, developing agriculture, arresting migration, and improving marketing facilities are taken into account. Other objectives include creating awareness on sustainability of natural resources, improving women's participation, and enhancing infrastructure facilities like storage and marketing."

The operational guidelines for promotion of Farmer Producer Organizations by using the PRODUCE Fund is given as **Annexure-I**. It has been decided to initiate works relating to promotion of Farmer Producer Organization as per the above operational guidelines by using the funds available under Producer Organization Development Fund (PODF), WDF (Rs.10 crore) and TDF (Rs.5 crore). The above mentioned funds available under WDF and TDF are to be utilized strictly for promotion of FPOs in the command area of watershed and wadi projects respectively. 3.  Grant assistance to POPIs/FPOs for undertaking various promotional interventions may be sanctioned by the CGM/OIC of the RO based on the recommendations of PSC constituted at RO for the purpose. The item-wise outlay indicated in **Appendix-I** are the maximum eligible amount. Therefore, while considering the proposal of POPIs, utmost care may be taken to assess the actual financial needs in individual cases without compromising on the effectiveness of the FPO.

For the purpose of reporting the physical progress in formation of FPOs under our scheme, the date of submitting application for registration may be construed as the date of FPO formation. In case of existing farmers organizations which have evolved as FPO without financial assistance from any agency and already registered in some legal form, these FPOs may also be considered under our scheme for extending promotional grant assistance to ensure their upliftment as sustainable business enterprise. However, in such cases ROs have to exercise due diligence to ensure their credibility, potential and future prospects to be able to function as business entity. 5.
