## 1.0 Aims And Objectives Of The Scheme

1.1  To provide holistic and broad based supportive ecosystem to form new 10,000 
FPOs to facilitate development of vibrant and sustainable income oriented farming and for overall socio-economic development and wellbeing of agrarian communities.  
1.2  To enhance productivity through efficient, cost-effective and sustainable resource 
use and realize higher returns through better liquidity and market linkages for their produce and become sustainable through collective action. 
1.3  To provide handholding and support to new FPOs up to 5 years from the year of 
creation in all aspects of management of FPO, inputs, production, processing 
and value addition, market linkages, credit linkages and use of technology etc. 
1.4 To provide effective capacity building to FPOs to develop agricultureentrepreneurship skills to become economically viable and self-sustaining beyond the period of support from government.  

## 2.0  Farmer Producer Organization (Fpo)

         FPO is a generic name, which means and includes farmer- producers' 
organization incorporated/ registered either under Part IXA of Companies Act or under Co-operative Societies Act of the concerned States and  formed for the purpose of leveraging collectives through economies of scale in production and marketing of agricultural and allied sector.  However, FPOs registered under Cooperative Societies Act of the State (including Mutually Aided or Self-reliant Cooperative Societies Act by whatever name it is called) for the purpose of this 
Scheme, is to be insulated from all kinds of interference including in election process and day today management through suitable provisioning in their Memorandum of Association and Bye-laws with a view to encourage healthy growth and development of FPO. 

## 3.0  Broad Services And Activities To Be Undertaken By Fpos

 
The FPOs may provide and undertake following relevant major services and activities for their development as may be necessary:-  
(i) 
Supply quality production inputs like seed, fertilizer, pesticides and such other inputs at reasonably lower wholesale rates. 
(ii) 
Make available need based production and post-production machinery and equipment like cultivator, tiller, sprinkler set, combine harvester and such other machinery and equipment on custom hiring basis for members to reduce the per 
unit production cost. 

(iii)  Make available value addition like cleaning, assaying, sorting, grading, packing 
and also farm level processing facilities at user charge basis on reasonably cheaper rate. Storage and transportation facilities may also be made available.

mushroom cultivation etc. 
(v) 
 Undertake aggregation of smaller lots of farmer-members' produce; add value to make them more marketable. 
(vi) Facilitate market information about the produce for judicious decision in 
production and marketing. 
(vii) Facilitate logistics services such as storage, transportation, loading/un-loading 
etc. on shared cost basis.  
(viii)  Market the aggregated produce with better negotiation strength to the buyers 
and in the marketing channels offering better and remunerative prices. 
 
ÔÅ∂ A Business Plan Linked   development in both medium and long-term 

## Will Be The Hallmark Of Strong Business Growth For Fpo. 4.0  Strategy For Formation Of Fpo And Identification Of Cluster Area

 
4.1 Formation and promotion of FPO is based on Produce Cluster Area, which is 
broadly defined as: 
"Produce Cluster aerA" for purpose of FPO formation and management herein means a geographical area wherein agricultural and allied produce such as ltSytlthytS h produce of similar or of almost similar nature is grown / cultivated; 
therefore, an FPO can be formed for leveraging economies of scale in production and marketing. This will also cover Organic Produce and Natural Farming.  

4.2 Produce cluster area is to be identified with the input of District Level Monitoring   
Committee (D-MC), State Level Consultative Committee (SLCC), other Ministries/Departments of Government of India and the States as well as with recommendations of Implementing Agencies with input from Cluster- Based Business Organization (CBBO) and suggestions of relevant Government of India Organizations.   
 
4.3 CBBOs will undertake Feasibility Study in assigned clusters which will include the 
following: 
(i) **Diagnostic study including Baseline survey** to find out produce and socio-
cultural similarity, existing gap and potential activity, interventions in terms of infrastructure, services, etc. required in the value chain of agricultural and horticultural produce including post-harvest management and marketing. Baseline survey should also identify current situation of farming, small, marginal and landless farmers for aggregation, to identify minimum geographical area for potential interventions etc.  

(ii) **Prospective Business Plan** in order to establish a fit case for formation of an 
economically sustainable FPO. 
4.4 FPO with a minimum farmer-members' size of 300 shall be eligible under the 
scheme in plains, while in North-Eastern and Hilly areas* (including such other 
areas of UTs), size of 100 shall be eligible. Farmer-members cohesively located with almost same interest are to be mobilized to form a group of 15-20 Members, calling the group as   Farmer Interest Group (FIG) or Self Help Group (SHG), Farmers Club (FC), Joint Liability Group (JLG) , Rythu Mitra Group. Such 20 or more groups from a produce cluster area or a village/ cluster of neighboring villages based on certain commonalities are to be put together to form an FPO with a minimum farmer-members size of 300 to be eligible under this scheme in plains while in Hilly and North Eastern regions, 7-8 are to be put together to form an FPO with a minimum farmer-members size of 100. It may provide special focus to include small, marginal and women farmers/women SHGs, SC/ST farmers and other economically weaker categories etc. as members to make FPOs more effective and inclusive. 
  * - Hilly area means area at a height of 1000 metre or above MSL 
 

4.5 However, efforts will be made to achieve   an average membership size of 500 
farmers in plain areas and 200 farmers in Hilly and North-Eastern regions to make them sizable for economic sustainability and profitability. Based on experience/ need, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) may revise the minimum membership norm per FPO, with the approval of Union Agriculture Minister.  Efforts will be made to form on an average two FPOs in at least each of potential 5,000 blocks out of existing about 7,000 blocks. However, efforts will be made to cover all blocks in the country. 4.6 The FPOs can federate at district level and State level based on their need of 
processing, branding and marketing of produce/trading of commodities, which are essential for scaling up for survivability and growth in an era of competition. 
Based on their need, success and product, they can federate at the National level also to promote packaging/branding and domestic/international trading of quality produce. Such Federation may avail advisory of National Project Management Agency (NPMA) as well as will be eligible for Credit Guarantee facility under the Scheme to strengthen their activities relating to setting up of infrastructure and supply chain for value addition and marketing. 

 
4.7 While adopting cluster-based approach for produce or produce mix, formation of 
FPOs will also focus on "One District One Product" approach for development of product specialization, in case the focused agriculture produce has been declared for that district, whereby FPOs will be encouraged for promoting processing, 
branding, marketing and export of the product for better value realization. There may be more than one cluster for one product in one district and a cluster also may 
extend beyond a district. However, to be an FPO economically sustainable and 
diversify risk & enhance returns, the FPO will also have additional product and service mix; so that there are enough activities and engagements with the members throughout the year. Furthermore, FPOs can federate at district level, State level & National level for the product identified as per their requirement of processing, 
branding and marketing.  
 
4.8 Concerted efforts will be made to prioritize formation of FPOs in aspirational 
districts through intense awareness programmes and making FPOs economically sustainable through adequate support, handholding, training & skill development. However, intensive efforts will be made to form & promote at least 15% of the 
total targeted 10,000 FPOs (i.e. 1,500 FPOs) in next 5 years in aspirational districts with at least one FPO in each block of aspirational districts of the country for their development. In order to promote the forest and minor forest produce by the tribal communities, intensive efforts will be made by the implementing agencies to prioritize formation and promotion of FPOs in the notified tribal areas in the country.  The benefits of quality input, technology, credit and value addition and processing as well as better market access should reach the tribal community and North-East Region through the Scheme in co-operation with Tribal Affairs Ministry, DONER and North Eastern Council (NEC).   
 
4.9 Existing FPOs will also be allowed to avail relevant benefits, if not earlier availed 
in any scheme of Government of India,   such as Credit Guarantee Fund and advisory services from National Project Management Agency (NPMA)  under the 
Scheme.  The FPOs which are already registered but have not been provided funds under any other schemes and have not yet started operation will also be covered under the Scheme.  

 

## 5.0 National Project Management Agency (Npma)

 
5.1 At national level, a National Project Management Agency (NPMA) will be set up 
by SFAC through transparent manner for providing overall project guidance, data maintenance through integrated portal and information management and monitoring. The NPMA will be equipped with the technical team with five categories of specialisation in Agriculture / Horticulture, Marketing and 
Processing, Incubation Service Provider, IT/MIS and Law & Accounting to provide overall guidance at all India level. 
 

## 5.2 Criteria For Identification Of Npma:

 
The NPMA will be expected to provide hand holding support and mentoring support to CBBOs, and need to have extensive experience in performing strategic roles, preferably in the agricultural domain at the national and state level. SFAC may, while formulating the criteria for selection of NPMA, take into account the appropriate qualifications and experience of requisite experts, relevant experience of organization/entity in guiding both companies and cooperative organizations as reasonably required for discharge of role envisaged for NPMA under the Scheme including the minimum net worth for suitability. The strength and experience may include strategic inputs around organizational 
management, processing, value addition, marketing & market linkage in agriculture/horticulture, accounting & auditing, compliance issues, ICT & MIS experience, incubation services and providing project management support to central and state governments, transaction and post transaction management support, and qualification of experts proposed for the work. The period of engagement of NPMA is to be decided suitably. 

## 5.3 Duties And Responsibilities Of Npma :

The role of the NPMA shall*, inter alia,* include those given as under-

## 8.0  Budgetary Provisions

8.1 The scheme on formation and promotion of 10,000 FPOs is to be implemented till 
2023-24 with budgetary support of Rs. 4496.00 crore. Since financial support 
excepting management cost is to be extended for five years, therefore, FPOs formed  will be required to be financially supported  till 2027-28, with the additional committed liability for period from 2024-25 till 2027-28 of Rs. 2369.00 
crore say Rs. 2370.00 crore. Thus, the total budgetary requirement up to 2027-28 would be Rs. 6866.00 crore. The budget requirement is to be met from overall allocations of DAC&FW.  

## 8.2 Payment To Implementing Agencies:

 
8.2.1   DAC&FW will make the advance release to the Implementing Agencies (IAs) on 
six monthly basis based on recommendation of N-PMAFSC, Annual Action Plan (AAP) of IAs and the due utilization certificate submitted to meet out the expenses for engaging NPMA, FPO formation & incubation cost to CBBO and also meeting out the cost of FPO management cost direct to concerned FPOs account on recommendation of concerned CBBO and Equity Grant etc. for effective and timely implementation of the programme. The Implementing Agencies will develop the payment schedule based on their various stages and component of payment involved. The Implementing Agencies will raise the demand to DAC&FW for release of payment. The Implementing Agencies will submit utilization certificate of last payment released as per GFR for releasing the next payment to them. In case of training, NABARD and NCDC will submit to N- PMAFSC the training schedule for a year with tentative expenditure for training 
through specialised training institutes organised through their respective nodal training Institute. DAC&FW will make due payment to NABARD and NCDC for training through specialised Institutions based on the demand raised by NABARD and NCDC respectively and utilisation certificate will be submitted to DAC&FW by both as due. Further, as regards DAC&FW's share towards Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF) to be maintained and managed by NABARD and NCDC, the DAC&FW will provide its matching share to NABARD and NCDC, as the case 
may be,  which in turn will submit detailed status of utilization to DAC&FW before raising the further demand for next installment of CGF. 

 

## 8.2.2   Payment Of Supervision Charges To Implementing Agency (Ia): Implementing Agencies (Viz. Sfac And Ncdc) Will Be Given Upfront Amount

computed @ 3% of estimated annual expenditure in the form of supervision charges to meet the expenses incurred in discharge of their duties and responsibilities; while additional amount computed @ 2% will be given to them 
based on their performance assessment.  The supervision amount will be released in two instalments and second instalment may be released after assessment of performance. This amount shall not include expenditure towards Credit Guarantee Scheme & Equity Grant. However, NABARD, as consented, will not charge any supervision charges for activities undertaken towards formation and promotion of FPOs under the Scheme. The expenditure on this 
account of supervision charges will be met from the budget of this Scheme.

10.1 Under the scheme, financial support to Farmer Producer Organization (FPO)     
@ up to maximum of Rs. 18 lakh / FPO or actual, whichever is lesser is to be provided during three years from the year of formation. The financial support is not meant for reimbursing the entire administrative and management cost of FPO but it is to provide the financial support to the FPOs to the extent provided  to 
make them sustainable and economically viable. Hence, the fourth year onwards of formation, the FPO has to manage their financial support from their own business activities. The indicative financial support broadly covers (i) the support for salary of its CEO/Manager (maximum up to Rs.25000/month) and Accountant (maximum up to Rs. 10000/month); (ii) one time registration cost(one time up to

Any expenditure of operations, management, working capital requirement and infrastructure development etc., over and above this, will be met by the FPOs from their financial resources. 
10.2 FPO being organization of farmers, it does not become feasible for FPO itself to 
professionally administer its activities and day to day business, therefore, FPO requires some professionally equipped Manager/CEO to administer its activities and day to day business with a sole objective to make FPO economically sustainable and farmers' benefiting agri-enterprise. Not only for business 
development but the value of professional is immense in democratizing the FPOs and strengthening its governing system. To substantiate the fact, the most successful example is of dairy co-operative in India where professional managers have contributed immensely to make it a success. There are other so many examples which prove the absolute requirement of professional managers. The number of professional staff could depend on geographical spread of business operation, diversity of activities and volume of business. However, an FPO should have minimum a CEO/Manager and an Accountant. Accountant is required in FPO to look after its day to day accounting work. Based on requirement, FPO can engage other staff also.  
10.3 The CEO/Manager is to be appointed by the executive body of the FPO who 
should be either graduate in agriculture / agriculture marketing / agri-business management or BBA or equivalent. Locally available professionals with 10+2 and 
preferably diploma in agriculture / agriculture marketing / agri-business management or in such other related areas may be preferable. The accountant should have educational qualification of 10+2 with Mathematics as a compulsory subject or alternatively with  Commerce or Accountancy background. If any members of the FPO meet the above criteria, they may be considered preferably in the selection process.

@ Rs. 25,000/- per month and of Accountant up to @ Rs.10,000/- per month with annual increment up to 5% is to be provided from the earmarked financial support for first 3 years only. Thereafter, FPOs will manage from their own resources to pay the salary of CEO/Manager and Accountant. In order to create 
interest of good professional activities of CEO/Accountant, the FPO may also offer higher payment with their own sources of funds on above of Govt. support. One CEO will provide full time services to one FPO at a time only. It will be duty and responsibility of respective Board of Directors (BoDs) and CBBO that quality of services is rendered by CEO for developing the business for sustainability of the FPO.  
10.5 **One time registration cost:** Under the scheme, the registration cost of 
incorporating FPOs under Companies Act. or registering under Co-operative Societies Act. will be reimbursable up to a limit of Rs. 40,000/- or actual, whichever is less; and remaining, if any, will be borne by respective FPO. 
10.6 FPO will forward the periodic utilization certificate for FPO management cost 
received and utilized as may be necessary to Implementing Agency through concerned CBBO.
