(2aid)
 ina ecord to COVID 19 pandemic. Initiatives
 
of the government
 
helped in management of the many
 
challenges posed by the lockdown.

 ICAR
 provided alerts to 548
crore farmers on the pre-cantions, safety measures and need for socal distancing while carrying
 
out the time bound
 
field operations.

 While the impact ofthe pandemic on agriculture
 
sector is stil unfolding, i is our endeavor to step up our prepareiness for the ensuing kharf cropping
 
season starting in June.

Xharif season
 
 
contributes about
130
to 140 m tonnes to the foodgrains
 
basket of the country. Under
 
good rainfl the season contributes
 
about 100
 m tof ce, 32m tof nutr-cereals, 8.2 m tof pulses,22 m tof
 
aleeds,
 32
 m bales of cotton, 10
 
mt of ute
 
and mesta and 378:m tof sugarcane.

In the backdrop
 
of anormal monsoon
 
forecast by IMD, ICAR
 has prepared agro-advisores for all major kharif crops in tune with the growing environments in diferent agro-ecologies spread across the country. While advocating best management practices, emphasis has been placed on efcient uilzation
 
of resources, sods, nutrients and cost-effective solutions to mitigate crop losses due
 
to pests
 
and
 
 
diseases. Mobilizing good quality improved
'seed of
 
pulses and ollseeds is crucial for ensuring higher productivity in the rainy
'season, While
 
the foodgrains stocks in our godowns from previous harvest came
 
in hhandy during the lockutown
 
period, we need to boost
 
our
 
production for increased avalability and
 
access to food and also replenish our reserves. 1am sure the timely
 
dissemination ofthe Kharif advisories to farmers in regional languages isa step in theright
 
direction, eget

## Preface

'CAR
 responded
 
to the challenges
 
posed
 
by the lockdown due to COVED
 
19
 
to farmers and
 
farming sector across the country in tune withthe policy directions and guldelins issued
 
by the Government of India to ll the States and UTS.

 Krishi
'Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)
 disseminated
 
the national and state-wise advisory issued to farmers for
 
complying with
 
the safety measures while carrying
 
out various
 
farm operations. Apart
 
from reaching
 
a large section of farmers through mKisan portal, VK
 reached out to 20]akh farmers
 
through social medi (6711
 whatsapp groups)
and other ICT channels, print and electronic media. In anticipation
 
of increased requirement, KVKs
 
also mbilizd about 52000
q of improved seed of major Khaif food crops
 
and
 78 lakhs
 
of planting
 
material for local supply to farmers.

"The Agricultural Technology
 
Applicaton Research Insittes (ATARI)
in 11
zones
'with technical inputs from research institutes
 
and
 
sate wmiversites of agriculture, horticulture, veterinary and
 
fisheries compiled the Kharif advisories for timely
<issemination
 
to farmers and farmer groups in
29 states through 718 KVKs along
'ith state line
 
departments.

 
The crop, livestock and fisheries advisories mainly deal
'with the best practices to be adopted by farmers during the ensuing kharif season.

Its my
 
fervent hope
 
thatthe advisories in regional languages
 
will help farmers to
 
make the right
 
choices for bumper
 
crop
 
yields and boosting of frm income.

## For Kharif 2020 Season Background

"The nation-wide lockaown due to COVED 19 pandemic
 
is continuing
 
as the Kharff
 
season ts fast approaching. The country receives
 
about
 75% of rainfall during the south
 
west monsoon period of
 
June-September.

In
 2019, a total
 
of
968.3
mm rainfall was received which is neary
 10% excess than
'the normal average ranfll. In ts frstlong-range
 
forecast fr Southwest Monsoon
 2020, the India
'Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted normal seaonal rainfall over the country which {slike
 
to be 100% ofthe Long Period Average (LPA)
of 880 mm.

 Rainfed agriculture occupies about
 51
 percent of country's net
 
sown area and accounts
 
for nearly 40 percent ofthe total food
'rodiction.

 Major field crops cultivated
 
in Kharif include cereals (paddy, maize, mille); ollsecds
 
(groundnut, soybean, sesame) ; pulses (ackgram, greengram,pigeonpea, moth bean, cluster bean and
 
horsegram); commercial crops like cotton sugarcane
 
pices,
 
vegetables and
 
fut crops.

 
"Thiskharifseason comes inthe aftermath oflockdowns eto COVID
19
an therefore disruption in
'normal operations/
 
logistics usually undertaken
 
during the pre-kharif
 
period likly. To cope with shortages in labour and timely availability
 
of
 
inputs at affordable prices, farmers need to enhance
'the use
 
of on-farm inputs especially organic manures, adopt best practices for increasing resource
'use efficiency and reduce cost of cultivation. In view of this, CAR
 has prepared agro-advisores
{or farmers fr the arly part
 
of Kharif season acros
 
the country in all the
29
 states covering majar crops, livestock, poultry and fisheries. The agro-advsory and
 
it repional
 
trndltions
 
have been
'organized for respective states under ATARI
Zones (Zones 
|
 
to 
11) ofthe Agricultural Extension Division
 
of CAR.

"The crop
 
livestock and
 
fsheries advisories mainly eal with best practices tobe
 
adopted by farmers during ensuing summer period and kharf season The
 
technical aspects covered inthe advisories are related
 
to seed, so, wate, nutrient
 
and health management
 
in crops and
 
livestock enterprises.

'+ 
Selection
 
of
 sultable crop
 cultivars in diferent crops and
 adhering to
 
optimum
sawing 
times
for
 
achieving higher productivity. For example, avoid cultivation
 
of
 
long
 duration varieties in
'transplanted paddy
 
in
 Punjab,
adhere
 
to
 sowing
 windaws
 
depending on
cultivar
 
in
bastmati

'+ Direct

in
areas
 
experiencing
 
labour
shortages for transplanted

in
 
addition to
 
wate saving.
 Machine

'+ 
Seed treatment with recommended chemicals/ bio-pesticides/ bio-Inoculants in all crops
'especially where farm saved seed/ untreated commercial seed {s used to improve seed
germination, bette crop stand, pest

'* 
Nutrient
 management and
 fertilizer application in all crops
 
to
 be
