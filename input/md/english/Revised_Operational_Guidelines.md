## 1. Objective Of The Scheme

 
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture sector by way of  

- 
Providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events 
- 
Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming 
- 
Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices 
- 
Ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector which will contribute to food security, crop diversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting 
farmers from production risks. 

## 2. Adoption Of Technology For Scheme Administration:

2.1 
 
In an endeavour to integrate Technology in implementation and execution of the Scheme, the Govt. of 
 
India has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) (www. pmfby.gov.in). This 
 
will bring in better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz.  Farmers, States, 
 
Insurers and Banks as well as real time dissemination of information and transparency.  
2.2 
 
The successful running of the Portal calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who 
 
will have the  responsibility for census coding and updating revenue/administrative units, AWS code 
 
mapping and updating requisite information/details as per login credential module.  
2.3 
 Implementing States and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and upload on the web Portal in the relevant module, basic information like notified areas, crops, sum insured, Govt. subsidy, and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance 
Companies in the particular insurance unit etc., well within the prescribed time. This will facilitate farmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. State 
Govt. and concerned Insurance Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions 
etc. 
2.4 
 Digitization of basic information/notification should compulsorily be done before floating tender documents which will be followed by entry of bidded Premium rates and name of selected Insurance 
Company immediately after finalization of bids and issue of work order. 
2.5 
 Since the National Crop Insurance Portal has been conceptualised for auto administration and seamless flow of data/information/reports on real time basis, State Govt. would not be allowed to 
create/use separate Portal/website for Crop Insurance purposes.  
2.6 
 
All Stakeholders have defined roles and responsibilities and accessibility to related modules on the 
 
Portal for administration of the Scheme. Details of operationalization of modules for each 
 
stakeholder are available on the Portal for ready reference.  
2.7 
 
Secured credential/login, preferably linked with Aadhaar Number and mobile OTP based, for all 
 
Stakeholders viz, Central Government, State Governments, Banks, empanelled Insurance Companies 
 
and their designated field functionaries will be provided on the Portal to enable them to 
 
enter/upload/download the requisite information.  
2.8 
 
Insurance Companies shall not distribute/collect/allow any other proforma/utility/web Portal etc for 
 
collecting details of insured farmers separately. However they may provide all requisite support to 
 
facilitate Bank Branches/PACS for uploading the farmer's details on the Portal well within the 
 
prescribed cut-off dates. 
2.9 
 
Only farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall be eligible for 
 
Insurance coverage and the premium subsidy from State and Central Govt. will be released 
 
accordingly. 
2.10 
 
All data pertaining to crop-wise, area-wise historical yield data, weather data, sown area, coverage 
 
and claims data, calamity years and actual yield shall be made available on the National Crop 
 
Insurance Portal for the purpose of premium rating, claim calculation etc. 
2.11 
 
Banks/Financial Institutions/other intermediaries need to compulsorily transfer the individual farmer's 
 
data electronically to the National Crop Insurance Portal. Accordingly Banks/FIs may endeavour to 
 
undertake CBS integration in a time bound manner for real time transfer of information/data.  
2.12 
  
It is also proposed to develop an integrated platform/portal for both PMFBY and Interest Subvention 
 
Scheme. The data/information of both the Schemes shall be auto synchronized to enable real time 
 
sharing of information and better program monitoring. 
2.13  
Insurance Companies shall compulsorily use technology/mobile applications for monitoring of crop 
 
health/Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in coordination with concerned States. States shall also 
 
facilitate Insurance Companies with Satellite Imagery/Usage of Drones by way of prior approval of 
 
agency from which such data can be sourced. This is required for better monitoring and ground-
 
truthing.  ICs can be active partners in facilitating use of technology. 
2.14  
States shall adopt technology, such as satellite and UAV remote sensing, for various applications such 
 
as crop area estimation and yield disputes and also promote the use of remote sensing and other 
 
related technology for CCE planning, yield estimation, loss assessment, assessment of prevented 
 
sowing and clustering of districts. 

## 3. Coverage Of Farmers

3.1 
 
All farmers including sharecroppers and tenant farmers growing the notified crops in the notified areas 
 
are eligible for coverage. However, farmers should have insurable interest for the notified/insured 
 
crops. The non-loanee farmers are required to submit necessary documentary evidence of land 
 
records prevailing in the State (Records of Right (RoR), Land possession Certificate (LPC) etc.) and/ 
 
or applicable contract/ agreement details/ other documents notified/ permitted by concerned State 
 
Govt. in case of sharecroppers/tenant farmers and the same should be defined by the respective 
 
States in the notification itself. 

## 3.1.1 Compulsory Component

3.1.1.1 
All farmers who have been sanctioned Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans from Financial Institutions (FIs) (i.e. loanee farmers) for the notified crop(s) season would be covered compulsorily. This provision shall override any decision taken by FIs including PACS exempting farmers from compulsory coverage of loanee farmers. 
3.1.1.2 
However non-standard KCC /crop loans as defined and as per prevailing practices of the concerned Banks/Govt. regulator shall not be covered compulsorily. However bank branches may facilitate  such  
farmers for enrolment as non-loanee farmers . 
3.1.1.3 
Merely, sanctioning of crop loan against other collateral securities including fixed deposits, gold/jewel 
loans, mortgage loans etc. without having insurable interest of the farmer on the insurable land and notified crops shall not be covered under the Scheme. 
3.1.2 
 Voluntary Component 
- The Scheme is optional for non-loanee farmers.  
- The insurance coverage will strictly be equivalent to sum insured/hectare, as defined in the Govt. 
notification or /and on National Crop Insurance Portal multiplied by sown area for notified crop.   
3.1.3  
Special efforts shall be made to ensure maximum coverage of SC/ ST/ Women farmers under the 
 
Scheme. Further Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) may be involved  in extension and awareness 
 
creation amongst farmers and obtaining feed-back of farmers about the implementation of the 
 
Scheme  
3.1.4 
 The implementing Insurance Company selected as L1 will be responsible for taking necessary 
measures to ensure at least 10% incremental increase in coverage of non-loanee farmers. However 
other empanelled Insurance Companies which have participated in the bidding and are keen for 
enrolment of non loanee farmers in the cluster may also be allowed to enrol non-loanee farmers at L1 premium rate. The interested companies have to inform their willingness in writing within seven days of finalisation of tender/issuance of work order to L1. It will however be the responsibility of all the 
Insurance Companies engaged in this process to ensure that duplicate enrolment does not happen in the given cluster/district. Engaging companies other than L1 for enrolling non loanee farmers will be taken up on a pilot basis in Districts notified by State Govt.  They shall enrol non loanee farmers as per 
conditions laid down in Para 17.5.  

3.1.5 
 These Insurance Company will maintain separate data of such non loanee farmers covered by them and enter the said data on the portal as per seasonality discipline detailed in Para 16.2. They shall be 
liable for payment of claims to such farmers. 
3.1.6 
 The exchange of information, co-witnessing of CCEs and sharing of yield data etc for the cluster by 
Government/NCIP will be limited to L1 Company only and it will be binding on other companies to 
accept it. However, the requisition for payment of Government subsidy in respect of non-loanee 
enrolled by them will be submitted directly to the Govt designated agency. 

## 4. Coverage Of Crops

I. Food crops (Cereals ,Millets and Pulses), 
II. Oilseeds 
III. Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops.  
 
In addition for perennial crops, pilots for coverage can be taken for those perennial horticultural crops for which standard methodology for yield estimation is available. 

## 5. Coverage Of Risks And Exclusions

5.1 
 
Following stages of the crop risks leading to crop loss are covered under the Scheme. Addition of new 
 
risks by the State Govt other than the one mentioned below, by the State Govt. is not permitted. 
5.1.1  
Prevented Sowing/Planting/Germination Risk: Insured area is prevented from sowing/ 
 
planting/germination due to deficit rainfall or adverse seasonal/weather conditions. 
5.1.2  
Standing Crop (Sowing to Harvesting): Comprehensive risk insurance is provided to cover yield losses 
 
due to non-preventable risks, viz. Drought, Dry spell, Flood, Inundation, widespread Pests and Disease 
 
attack, Landslides, Fire due to natural causes ,Lightening, Storm, Hailstorm and Cyclone. 
5.1.3  
Post-Harvest Losses: Coverage is available only upto a maximum period of two weeks from harvesting, 
 
for those crops which are  required to be dried  in cut and spread / small bundled condition in the field 
 
after harvesting against specific perils of Hailstorm, Cyclone, Cyclonic rains and Unseasonal rains. 
5.1.4  
Localized Calamities: Loss/damage to notified insured crops resulting from occurrence of identified 
 
localized risks of Hailstorm, Landslide, Inundation, Cloud burst and Natural fire due to lightening 
 
affecting isolated farms in the notified area. 
5.1.5  
Add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals: The States may consider providing  
 
add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be 
 
substantial and is identifiable. Detailed protocol and procedure for evaluation of bids will be 
 
issued separately by GOI in consultation with Ministry of Environment and Forest and GIC Re.  
The  
 
add-on coverage will be optional for the farmers and applicable notional premium will be borne by the 
 
farmer, however the State Govts may consider providing additional subsidy on this coverage, 
 
wherever notified. The  actuarial premium rates for add-on coverage should be sought in the bid 
 
itself from the  Insurance Companies, however the  add-on actuarial premium  rate 
will 
be 
 
considered separately  and shall not form part of evaluation of L1.    
 
5.1.6  
General Exclusions: Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other 
 
preventable risks shall be excluded. 
5.1.7  
State Govts./UTs ,in consultation with SLCCCI, can exclude any of the aforesaid perils listed above 
 
which is  not prevailing in their State/UT 
5.1.8  
Yield loss damage for localised calamities and post harvest losses will be assessed on the basis of 
 
individual insured farm level and hence lodging of loss information by farmer/designated agencies 
 
is essential. For remaining risks losses are due to widespread calamities. Hence lodging of 
 
information for claims by insured farmers / designated agencies for such wise spread calamities is 
 
not essential. Claims will be calculated based on the loss assessment report/average yield 
 
submitted by concerned State Govt. 

## 6. Preconditions For Implementation Of The Scheme 6.1 States:

 
 
Issuance of Notification by State Govt. / UT for implementation of the Scheme (PMFBY) will imply 
 
their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The main conditions 
 
relating to PMFBY which are binding on States/UTs are as follows: 
6.1.1  
Adoption of innovative technology especially Smart phones/ hand held devices for capturing conduct 
 
of CCEs through CCE-Agri App  and use of  NCIP platform for  flow of information and auto 
 
administration of the scheme 
 
6.1.2  
State has to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at the level of notified 
 
insurance unit area; 
6.1.3  
CCE based yield data will be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal/submitted to Insurance 
 
Company within the notified cut off date ; 
6.1.4  
State/ UT will make necessary budgetary provision  for  premium subsidy based on fair estimates, at 
 
the beginning of the crop season; 
6.1.5  
To carry out pilot studies for improved yield estimations using technology. 
6.1.6  
Department of State Govt. which was earlier looking after implementation of erstwhile National 
 
Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS)/ National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP*) may be designated 
 
as Nodal Department for implementation of PMFBY. The State Level Coordination Committee on Crop 
 
Insurance (SLCCCI) which was overseeing implementation of NAIS and NCIP* may be authorized to 
 
oversee implementation of PMFBY. The States/UTs which had not implemented the NAIS / NCIP* shall 
 
constitute SLCCCI for implementation of PMFBY on the lines similar to that of NAIS/NCIP*. The present 
 
composition of SLCCCI may be strengthened by including representatives from State Horticulture 
 
Dept., State Remote Sensing Application Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Farmers' 
 
Representatives and empanelled Insurance Companies for implementing PMFBY. Chairman of SLCCCI 
 
may co-opt representatives from other departments/agencies, if considered necessary. 

## 6.2 Insurance Company:

 
 
Empanelment of Insurance Companies and their participation for implementation of the Scheme 
 
(PMFBY) will imply their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The 
 
empanelled Insurance Companies have to deploy requisite infrastructure and resources for 
 
implementation of PMFBY particularly for following identified major activities: 
6.2.1  
To carry out Pilot study for leveraging new technology for effective implementation of Scheme in  a 
 
transparent manner,  
6.2.2  
Deployment of requisite  infrastructure to increase the outreach to rural farmers at their doorstep,  
6.2.3  
Commitment for at least 10  % incremental increase in Non loanee coverage,  
6.2.4  
Deployment of sufficient manpower to co-observe CCEs and allied activities and compulsory use of 
 
CCE Co-observation app,  
6.2.5  
Allocation of requisite resources and commitment for advertisements, awareness generation and 
 
capacity building of stakeholders about the Scheme. The detailed planning for the same should be 
 
submitted to Central and State Govt. in advance, before the start of each season. 

## 6.3 Submission Of Uid (Aadhaar) By Farmer:

6.3.1  
Aadhaar has been made mandatory for availing Crop insurance from Kharif 2017 season onwards. 
 
Therefore, all banks are advised to mandatorily obtain Aadhaar number of their farmers and the same 
 
applies 
for 
non-loanee 
farmers 
enrolled 
through 
banks/Insurance 
companies/insurance 
 
intermediaries. 
6.3.2  
Farmers not having Aadhaar ID may also enrol under PMFBY subject to their enrolment for 
 
Aadhaar and submission of proof of such enrolment as per notification No. 334.dated 8th February, 
 
2017 issued by GOI under Section 7 of Aadhaar Act 2016(Targeted Delivery of Financial and other 
 
Subsidies, Benefits and Services). Copy of the notification may be perused on www.pmfby.gov.in. This 
 
may be  subject to further directions issued by Govt. from time to time. 
6.3.3 
 
All banks have to compulsorily take Aadhaar/Aadhaar enrolment number as per notification under  Aadhaar Act before sanction of crop loan/KCC under Interest Subvention Scheme. Hence the coverage 
 
of loanee farmers without Aadhaar does not arise and such accounts need to be reviewed by the 
 
concerned bank branch regularly. 

## 7. Notification 7.1 Procedure For Issuance Of Notification By The States/Uts:

7.1.1 
 Prior to the commencement of the Kharif season, preferably in the beginning of November of previous year, meeting of SLCCCI should be convened for finalising various terms and conditions and calling of bids/issuance of the bid notice to all empanelled Insurance Companies for selection to implement the 
Scheme during the bid/ risk period. State / UT Govt. should ensure the issuance of the notification and 
its circulation to all concerned agencies/ departments/ institutions at least one month in advance of the commencement of the crop season incorporating all the essential details about insured crops, areas, Scale of Finance, Sum Insured, Threshold Yield at insurance unit (IU) level for notified crops, period of contract, bidder's evaluation and selection methodology, premium rate for farmers, Govt. 
subsidy along with seasonality discipline/ cut off date for each activity etc. Notification should be issued for at least one year to facilitate banks for deduction of premium for a year  
7.1.2 
In order to have transparency and system driven approach for crop insurance implementation, all the details as mentioned in para 7.1.1 above need to be part of the Tender Document and State Notification and no modification in the terms and condition enumerated in the tender document shall 
be allowed post tendering. 
7.1.3 
Bidding annexures may be generated through Portal. Procedure and template are available on National Crop Insurance Portal. Before floating the Tender, last 10 years yield data at notified/available level and TY at notified unit should be uploaded on the Portal in the given template and should be made part of the Tender.  
7.1.4 
Calculation of lowest weighted premium of district shall be based on the insured areas of notified crops in each district during last year/season. However, in absence of insured area of last year/season 
for all proposed crops or any crop, net sown area of that crop(s) will be considered for calculation of weighted premium of district. This data will be used for calculation of L1 only. 
7.1.5 
Bidding **shall be done through e-tendering** and work order may be released within 2 weeks of the 
opening of the Tender. 
7.1.6 
Depending on the risk profile, historical loss cost and cost benefit analysis for the proposed crop(s) in district(s) of any cluster, if the State Government feels that the premium rate likely to be offered by bidding Insurance Companies would be abnormally high, then the State Govt. can fix a ceiling on 
premium rates for such crop(s) proposed to be included in the bidding evaluation for the bidding period. However, recourse to this ceiling provision may be done only in well justified cases and not as 
a general practice. The ceiling premium rate may be derived based on statistical evaluation/actuarial premium analysis, loss cost, historical payout etc and name of such crop should be disclosed by State 
Govt. compulsorily in the tender document. 
7.1.7 
In such cases where a ceiling has been indicated, State government must call financial bids in two step 
bidding or in two separate envelopes. First bid/envelop is for disclosing the premium rate offered by each participating Insurance Company for such ceiling crops and must be categorised under "Ceiling 
Premium Rate" and  2nd  bid envelop is for bidding of crop wise premium rate for all crops included in tender. Time interval for opening of both bid/envelop should be compulsorily mentioned in the bidding documents and should preferably be on the same day. All participating Insurance Companies have to submit the bid offer as per the procedure mentioned above. 

7.1.8 
State Govt. shall first evaluate first envelop of the bid keeping in view the premium offered by each individual participating Insurance company and if the risk propensity and weather susceptibility of the crop and/or historical claim/loss data doesn't support the actuarial rates offered by the participating Insurance Companies, such crop(s) may be dropped from the list of proposed crops for notification by the State Government and evaluation for L1 bidder should be done strictly based on the rates offered for left out/remaining crops. The second envelope shall be opened by the State Govt. only after 
decision on dropping the proposed crops/or accepting the premium rates offered by participating 
Insurance companies has been taken by the State Govt. If State Govt decides not to drop all proposed crop(s)/ few crops for which premium rate obtained in separate envelop of "Ceiling Premium Rate" from the bidding process, then L1 will be calculated by inclusion of premium offered for all crops/remaining crops. 
7.1.9 
States should avoid doing re-tendering as a general practice. Re-tendering may be held only in 
exceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of GOI after submission of a request with 
detailed reasons. GOI on its part will give its decision within 5 working days of the receipt of the request.  
7.1.10 
States are required to compulsorily upload Meeting Notices, Tender Documents, Addendums, requisite data and other relevant information on the National Crop Insurance Portal for faster communication and response. Accordingly the subsequent notifications, circulars, directives shall also be uploaded on the Portal as and when issued for wider reach and circulation. 
7.1.11  
All conditions proposed to be stipulated by State Govt. should be incorporated in bid document itself 
 
and no new condition should be included in the notification. In case ICs have any objection to any 
 
Tender condition which is in conflict with guidelines, they can make a reference to State govt. with a 
 
copy to GOI within 3 days of issuance of Tender  
7.1.12  
L1 bidder will not be allowed to withdraw their bid after opening of bids/allotment of work. If L1 
 
bidder withdraws then financial loss, if any, to the State Govt. due to retendering /assignment  of 
 
work to others, due to increase in actuarial premium rate from previously declared L1 rate, shall  be 
 
recovered from the withdrawing L1 bidder. 

## 7.2 Notification Of  Crops,  Areas And Implementing Agency (Ia)

7.2.1 
The Scheme shall operate on the principle of "Area Approach" in the selected defined areas called Insurance Unit (IU). State Govt. /UT will notify crops and defined areas covered during the season in 
accordance with decision taken in the meeting of SLCCCI. State/UT Govt. should notify Village/Village Panchayat or any other equivalent unit as an insurance unit for major crops defined at District / 
Taluka or equivalent level. For **other crops** it may be a unit of size above the level of Village/village 
Panchayat. For defining a crop as a major crop for deciding the Insurance Unit level, the sown area of 

## That Crop Should Be At Least 25% Of Gross Cropped Area In A District/  Taluka Or Equivalent Level

7.2.2 
For the claims arising out of crop damage due to post-harvest  losses and localized risks, assessment of 
damage will be made on individual farm basis as outlined in (Section 21, para 21.4 and 21.5 
respectively). 
7.2.3 
SLCCCI will, for the purpose of notification, consider factors such as availability of past yield data based on CCEs for adequate number of years (at least 7 years for calculation of threshold yield), cropped acreage and capacity for estimating yield during proposed season, etc. State govt. should endeavour to 
cover all the major crops grown in all the districts of the State. States should ensure that a standard methodology of yield estimation exists for all the crops proposed to be notified 
7.2.4 
State Govt./ UT should provide 10 years' historical yield data in soft format(in Excel) in English  to 
Insurance Companies for calculation of threshold yield , premium rates etc. at insurance unit area and in its absence, data at next higher unit/nearest neighbouring unit/weighted average of contiguous 
units, as decided by the SLCCCI shall be used. The level and name of notified area of insurance unit must be part of notification and should be provided at the time of bidding itself.  
7.2.5 
In case State Govts/UT proposes to notify irrigated and un-irrigated areas under a crop separately, 
they shall ensure that minimum CCEs are planned and conducted for irrigated and un-irrigated crops separately in such areas. In addition, past yield data for requisite number of years will have to be made available separately for both 
7.2.6 
While notifying the crop(s) where a specific conversion factor is being used for reporting of yield such as in the case of rice/paddy etc, due care should be taken by the State Nodal Department to use the 
relevant specific nomenclature for disclosure of Average Yield, Threshold Yield and Actual Yield while releasing the Tender Document and submission of Yield data and CCE data for calculation of admissible 
claims. Insurance Companies will also be responsible for prior scrutiny of Tender document. Information/data provided in Tender document will be treated as final and in case of any error/ 
misreporting/disparity, State Govt. and Insurance Company will be equally liable for payment of 
additional claims arising on account of it, if any. 
7.2.7 
For the current season or subsequent seasons (in a multi-year contract), the States, if required, can 
notify additional IUs or de-notify  certain IUs  subject to maximum deviation of 10% of already notified 
IUs for the crop within a district at the same premium rate, before the cut-off date for debit of premium. If the  deviation is >10% or in case of addition of new crop, actuarial premium rate may be worked out either by calculation of weighted average premium rate as prevalent in contiguous districts  or  by applying appropriate loading on the existing premium rate. The rates for such crops will be determined /verified by TSU and its decision will be binding on both States and ICs. 
7.2.8 
States implementing PMFBY at Village/ Village Panchayat level for major crops shall be entitled for 
50% reimbursement of incremental expenses of CCEs and cost of smart phones/ improved technology **from GOI.** Only eligible items will be considered for reimbursement. The data source for 
calculation of admissibility of incremental CCEs will be the National Crop Insurance Portal. 
  

## 7.3 Notification Of Indemnity Level, Average Yield And Threshold Yield

7.3.1 
Three levels of Indemnity, viz., 70%, 80% and 90%. SLCCCI in consultation with Insurance Companies 
shall approve indemnity levels for notified crops at district level. Threshold Yield (TY) shall be notified 
in the Tender for the current season and the same will be used for claim calculation for that season. The Average Yield of a notified crop in Insurance Unit (IU) will be average yield of best five years out of 
last seven years. The Threshold yield of the notified crop is equal to Average Yield multiplied by 
Indemnity level. The Threshold Yield for any crop and IU shall compulsorily be part of the notification for the season and shall not change at any point during that season.  
7.3.2 
Calculation and Notification of Threshold Yield: For calculation of Threshold Yield, historical average 
yield of best five out of last seven years shall be considered. Further Threshold Yield should be defined 
only at notified area level and once notified in the Notification issued by the State should not be 
changed at later stage under any circumstances. In case of multi-year contract, the Threshold Yield for 
the subsequent years shall be revised by adding/considering the yields of immediate previous corresponding season. The revised TY and Sum Insured (if revised) should be notified accordingly at the beginning of each crop season in case of multi-year tender.  

## 7.4 Notification Of Seasonality Discipline:

7.4.1 
State Govt./ UT  in accordance  with the broad seasonality defined/prescribed in the Operational Guidelines shall also notify seasonality discipline for various activities under the Scheme viz. submission of insurance proposals/application, consolidated declarations by banks, remittance of 
premium to Insurance Companies, uploading of individual covered farmer's data on National Crop Insurance Portal, submission of yield data, claim assessment of losses for(i) standing crop(ii) localized calamities,(iii) prevented sowing, iv) post harvest losses, (v) On-Account payment for major calamities, etc as per the provisions of the Scheme. 
 
*In exceptional cases, where last corresponding season yield data is not available at the time of
 
Bidding/Notification, yield data is to be provided before the harvesting of the current season. However 
 
the yield data upto last to last corresponding season should be provided at the time of bidding itself. 
 
However, in such cases admissible claims will be anyway calculated on the basis of yield data of last 7 
 
years only. 

## 7.5 Notification Of Automatic Weather Stations (Aws)

7.5.1  
Only those AWS/ARGs of IMD/State Govt. /private agencies should be considered and notified which are as per standards defined by IMD/WMO and are certified and approved by IMD/any agency to be 
notified by the State/Central govt. These must be optimally operational and be able to provide real 
time  weather data.  AWS/ARG   of private agencies should only be considered in absence of properly 
functioning AWS/ARGs of IMD/ State Govt. AWS /ARG data sourced for crop insurance should be 
transferred on real time basis to National Portal. The detailed guidelines for sharing of weather data on the Portal will be circulated separately.  
7.5.2  
State govt can explore the possibility to create dense AWS/ARG network on PPP Mode for which GOI 
will provide 50% of the viability gap funding. 
 

7.5.3  
The following data sources may be used for validation of on account   claims and claims for prevented 
sowing:  
- Satellite/UAV Remote  Sensing Data 
- AWS/ARG Data 
- MNCFC Report/Study on drought assessment 
7.5.4  
State Govt. shall notify concerned weather data provider/ expert agency whose report/ methodology 
 
would be used in assessing the extent of losses and computation of claims. Cost of such weather data 
 
shall be borne by the concerned Insurance Companies. The notified AWS and ARG should fulfil/ meet 
 
the standards/ norms/ criteria specified by the concerned authorities from time to time. 

## 8. Engagement Of Common Service Centres (Cscs) And Intermediaries For Coverage Of Non-Loanee Farmers:

8.1 
 
CSCs under Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeITY) have been engaged to enrol 
 
non-loanee farmers. The Insurance Companies are required to enter into a separate agreement with 
 
CSC and pay service charges as fixed by DAC&FW, GOI per farmer per village per season. No other 
 
agreement or payment is required to be made for this purpose. Nodal agency for engagement with 
 
Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Insurance Companies will be CSC-SPV, a company 
 
established under MeITY for carrying out e-governance initiatives of GoI.

Govt. of India and State Govt. will endeavour to utilize Public Financial Management System 
 
(PFMS)/PFMS linked systems to remit the funds to State Govt/agencies 
9.2 
Banks, CSC and Insurance Agents are required to remit the premium payment to respective Insurance 
Company mandatorily through Payment gateway (Pay-Gov) of National Crop Insurance Portal or through RTGS/NEFT followed by mandatory uploading of payment details on National Crop Insurance Portal within stipulated date. Bank details of Insurance Companies shall be made available on National Crop Insurance Portal itself. Accordingly, all Stakeholders including Insurance Companies, Bank branches, CSC and Insurance Agents must compulsorily maintain dedicated bank accounts for this purpose. No remittance/financial transaction in the form of Banker's cheque/Demand Draft will be allowed. 

9.3 
Insurance companies will be provided login access to the essential crop notification data/information along with farmer level coverage data including banking details of individual farmers on the National Crop Insurance Portal to reconcile, verify, validate and calculate payable claims and remit  the same directly into pre-declared bank accounts linked to the National Crop Insurance Portal. 

## 10. Census Code Mapping Of Entities;

10.1 
 All States shall map census codes of their villages with the higher administrative/revenue units like Gram Panchayat, Firkas, Patwar Circles, Revenue Circles, Hoblis, Mandals, Blocks, Tehsils,  Talukas, Districts and Automatic Weather Stations/Backup Weather Stations. This will create a standard mechanism of mapping and identification across the country.   
10.2 
 Further, for purposes of obtaining accurate location, State Govts. must also provide geo coded  
(latitude. & longitude) village maps on digital format for integration with other Apps like CCEs Agri App, Loss reporting/Assessment App etc. 

## 11. Digitization Of Land Records

11.1 
 State Govts. are advised to digitize their revenue records using village Census codes so that the 
individual land records of farmers can be accessed through the National Crop Insurance Portal for crop insurance. This will help the Govt. to reach and identify individual beneficiaries and bring utmost transparency and authenticity in benefit transfer. 

## 12. Sum Insured /Coverage Limit

12.1 
 Sum Insured per hectare for both loanee and non-loanee farmers will be same and equal to the Scale 
of Finance as decided by the DLTC/SLTC, and would be pre-declared by SLCCCI and notified. No other calculation of Scale of Finance will be applicable. Sum Insured for individual farmer is equal to the SOF 
per hectare multiplied by area of the notified crop proposed by the farmer for insurance. Area under 
cultivation shall always be expressed in hectare'. 
12.2 
 In cases where crops are separately notified under irrigated, un-irrigated category by State Govts. Sum 
insured for irrigated and un-irrigated areas should be separately indicated. 
 

## 13. Premium Rates And Premium Subsidy

13.1  
The Actuarial Premium Rate (APR) would be charged under PMFBY by implementing Insurance 
 
Company. The rate of premium payable by the farmer will be as per the following Table 1:

## 13.2 Payment Of Govt. Subsidy:

13.2.1  
The difference between Actuarial Premium Rate and the rate of Insurance premium payable by 
 
farmers shall be treated as Rate of Normal Premium Subsidy, which shall be shared equally by the 
 
Centre and State Govts. However, the State/ UT Govts. are free to extend additional subsidy over and 
 
above the normal subsidy from its budget. In other words, additional subsidy, if any shall be borne 
 
entirely by the State/ UT Govt. Subsidy in premium is allowed only to the extent of Sum Insured. 
13.2.2  
Govt. premium subsidy to the Private empanelled Insurance Companies may be routed  through 
 
Agricultural Insurance Company (AIC) or any agency designated by GOI strictly as per the 
 
guidelines/order of the Govt. This may be reviewed later by Central Govt. and changed  accordingly if 
 
necessary. Accordingly, AIC/ other designated agency is empowered to call/ collect all requisite 
 
information related to implementation of the Scheme and utilization of Govt. funds and to share 
 
the same with the Govt for better planning, implementation and monitoring of the Scheme. The 
 
premium subsidy will be routed through PFMS/PFMS linked systems strictly based on the MIS 
 
generated through National Crop Insurance Portal. 
13.2.3  
Govt, both Centre and State,  will  release their share of advance subsidy (First Instalment) equivalent 
 
to 50% of 80% of their respective share of subsidy in corresponding previous season subject to 
 
fulfilment of General Financial Rule(GFR)/guidelines in the matter without waiting for coverage 
 
details  for the ongoing  season. 
13.2.4  
To facilitate settlement of prevented risk/ mid season adversity/localized claims: ICs should release the 
 
admissible claim amount to the beneficiary immediately after receipt of farmers premium and 
 
advance subsidy (1st Instalment) and without waiting for release of final subsidy (Second Instalment) 
 
from  
Govt. The  premium in  respect of affected IUs including subsidy to enable settlement of 
 
claims arising due to above events in respect of all such beneficiaries shall be adjusted from the fund 
 
already  available with ICs as advance upfront subsidy (First Instalment) to facilitate compliance of 
 
Section 64 B  of Insurance Act/Regulation of IRDAI 
13.2.5  
All admissible claims based on Yield data/Post harvest losses will be settled on receipt of second 
 
installment of Govt. subsidy to be paid on the basis of tentative business statistics generated on the 
 
portal after 15 days of period specified for auto approval of applications on the Portal. The remaining 
 
Govt. subsidy, if any will be paid after reconciliation of all business statistics for the season on portal. 
13.2.6  
All empanelled insurance companies including private insurance companies shall provide free access 
 
to the Central/State level agencies including CAG authorized to verify the accounts and audit in 
 
respect of Crop Insurance. 
13.2.7  
In case, the State Govt. subsidizes full farmers' share of premium, in that case a token amount of at 
 
least Re. 1 should compulsorily be charged from the farmer to facilitate electronic tracking. 
13.2.8  
State Govt. has to release the State share of premium subsidy within 3 months from premium 
 
requisition by concerned Insurance Company failing which 1% interest per month shall be levied as 
 
penalty on the State govt. 

## 13.3 Payment Of Claim Liabilities:

13.3.1 
 Insurance company shall take all necessary steps to take appropriate reinsurance cover for their portfolio in order to safeguard insured's interest. In case premium to claims ratio exceeds 1:3.5 or percentage of claims to Sum Insured exceeds 35%, whichever is higher, at the National Level in a crop 
season, then Govt. will provide protection to Insurance Companies. The losses exceeding the above mentioned level in the crop season would be met from equal contribution of the Central Govt. and the 
concerned State/UT Govts. In case losses are below the above mentioned condition, insurers shall be responsible to settle the admissible claims. 

## 14. Budget For Administrative Expenses

14.1   
At least 2% of the total budget for PMFBY shall be earmarked by State/UTs for administrative 
 
expenses, publicity, yield/loss assessment expenses, purchase of smart phones, adoption of new 
 
technology, setting up of State Technical Support Unit (STSU), travelling and contingency fund.  
14.2 
Govt. of India has already made provisions for separate allocations under sub heads like Salaries, Domestic Travel Expenses, Technology interventions, Office Expenses, other Administrative Expenses 
and Professional Services etc. for Crop Insurance program under PMFBY/RWBCIS. States should make provisions and  budgetary allocation on similar lines including subhead for incremental cost of CCEs. 

## 15. Technical Support Unit (Tsu)/ Cpmu

15.1 
 National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) or Central Program Management Unit (CPMU) will be created 
at the Central level at the earliest to provide support and advise on risk classification & rating, development of new products, methodology for loss assessment, legal works, workshop/training & capacity building, alongwith use of technology including innovation/ replication, digitisation of administration of Schemes through Crop Insurance Portal etc.  
15.2 
 NTSU shall calculate Loss Cost (LC) i.e. Claims as percentage (%) of Sum Insured (SI) observed in case of notified crop(s) in notified unit area of insurance during the preceding 10 similar crop seasons (Kharif/ Rabi) along with approximate actuarial premium rate of the crops proposed to be notified for the season. This loss cost/premium rate shall be based on the latest available yield data in month of 
January for Kharif crops and **July** for Rabi crops and shall be provided to DAC & FW/ Concerned States 
on request before invitation for premium bidding. This calculation to be done by NTSU on behalf of DAC & FW is only for official purposes to have information on the approximate cost to the IA for covering the risks so as to evaluate the bids in proper perspective.  
15.3 
 National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) may also develop a suitable methodology for risk classification/premium rating by using historical yield data, weather data, use and level of inputs/irrigation/technology in crop cultivation, remote sensing data/information etc. for standardization of methodology for risk perception and premium rating for crop insurance in the 
country. 
15.4 
 In addition to National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) / Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) at Central level, all States/UTs implementing Schemes should also create a separate TSU/PMU at State HQ level with sufficient technical experts/staff to ensure proper implementation of the Scheme.  State TSU (STSU) may also opt for members on contractual/temporary basis or take services of other organizations/research institutes etc as deemed fit. However, States shall have to allocate a separate budget for running the STSU. 
 

## 16. Seasonality Discipline

16.1 
 The cut-off date is uniform for both loanee and non-loanee cultivators. The State-wise cut-off dates for 
 different crops shall be based on Crop Calendar of major crops published from time to time by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, DAC&FW,GOI. The latest copy of the Crop Calendar (District 
Wise, Crop Wise) is available on www.pmfby.gov.in. The SLCCCI, shall besides considering the 
prevailing agro-climatic conditions, rainfall distribution/ availability of water for irrigation, sowing 
pattern etc. in consultation with the Insurance Company fix seasonality discipline of the coverage and other activities in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards.  If this is violated by SLCCCI, GOI may decide not to provide premium subsidy. 
16.2 
 The **broad indicative seasonality discipline** is given in the Table 2 below:

16.3 
 In case the cut-off date falls on a public holiday or is declared as public holiday by the Govt. or there is 
disruption of services due to strikes/shut-down etc., the next working day will be treated as the cut-off 
date. Concerned States have to take decision in this regard suo moto. For this State Govts should send a formal intimation to GoI. 

16.4 
 In case of disruption of services due to natural events beyond human control or technical/software/network issues with the National Crop Insurance Portal the subsequent dates 
(other than the cut-off dates for Enrolment/Premium Debit/Collection) may be extended by the competent authority on the basis of specific written inputs from Portal Development and Maintenance Agency. However due care has to be taken that such extension does not lead to moral hazard and misuse of the Scheme and suitable measures should be put forth for the same accordingly. 

16.5 
 Further, in case of three crops / season pattern, a modified seasonality discipline keeping in view the 
overall seasonality discipline prescribed above, shall be adopted by SLCCCI. 
16.6 
 Keeping in view the specific nature of crop and scope for catastrophic crop damage, SLCCCI shall fix 
seasonality in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards and also ensure early payment of claims to eligible insured farmers. Scheme also has provisions for claims 
due to prevented sowing and option to change the insured crop. Hence, State Govt. will take all 
necessary steps to ensure enrolment of farmers well within the stipulated time under the Scheme. 
No request/relaxation for extension in the above seasonality/cut-off dates shall be considered/ 
granted by GoI once it is fixed and notified for the crop season. However, preponement in cut off dates shall be considered on case to case basis. If any State/ UT extends the above seasonality/ cut off dates on their-own, then Central share of premium subsidy shall not be provided for the concerned notified 
crops /areas. 
16.7 
 It may be noted that, under no circumstance, will DAC&FW or any State/UT Govt.   extend the cutoff dates for enrolment of farmers. However, in case the States/UT decide to do so, it may be done only in agreement with implementing Insurance Company. In such cases, however no central premium subsidy will be provided for the areas/farmers/crops which are covered/ insured in the extended period and the concerned State has to bear the entire subsidy liability for the coverage in the extended period. 
16.8 
 In a situation where total claims have been approved/auto approved, the company shall be liable to pay claims within 2 weeks of calculation/auto approval of claims irrespective of whether Insurance 
Companies have raised the bill for 2nd Instalment of premium subsidy or not. Hence, it is binding on the 
Insurance Company to seek the 2nd Instalment of premium subsidy within the timelines. 
16.9 
 All admissible claims shall mandatorily be paid within the stipulated cutoff date failing which penal interest @ 12% per annum shall be payable on admissible pending claims beyond 30 days of uploading AY on portal/provided in soft copy by State Govt. subject to release of applicable subsidy by State Govt. 

## 17. Collection Of Proposals And Premium From Farmers

17.1 
 The Nodal Bank system adopted under NAIS/ NCIP* wherein the implementing Insurance Company is 
not required to deal with all the loan disbursing points and instead deals only with designated Nodal banks, will continue under PMFBY only for Cooperative Banks , However, for Commercial Banks/RRBs, 
the individual bank branches shall act as Nodal branch for this purpose. The concerned Lead bank and Regional offices/ Administrative offices of Commercial banks/RRBs will provide necessary guidelines to concerned bank branches and coordinate with them to ensure that all concerned branches compulsorily remit the farmers premium electronically through NEFT/RTGS to be routed through NCIP to concerned  Insurance Companies and submit the consolidated proposals/information in prescribed format  well within the stipulated cut-off dates and also upload the details of individual 
covered/insured farmers  on National Crop Insurance  Portal. Besides, for the coverage of non-loanee 
farmers only, Insurance Company may also use IRDAI approved micro insurance agents/ insurance 
intermediaries. However, details of such agents should compulsorily be submitted to State Govt. and Govt. of India well before the start of the season for creating their credentials and subsequent 
uploading of details of individual insured/covered farmers on Portal within stipulated timelines.  
17.2 
 Consolidated declaration/ proposal formats to be submitted physically/ electronically by Nodal banks/Branches shall contain details about Insurance Unit, sum insured per unit, premium per unit, total area insured of the farmers, number and category of farmers covered (small and marginal or other)and number of farmers under other categories(SC/ST/others)/Women along with their bank account details etc.(bank/their branches) as per the application form provided on the National Crop 
Insurance Portal. Banks are required to upload the insured farmers' data mandatorily on the National Crop Insurance Portal. No other platform shall be used for uploading/submission of farmers' data. Those farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall only be eligible for Insurance coverage and accordingly the premium subsidy will also be released. In cases where farmers are denied crop insurance due to incorrect/ partial/non-uploading of their details on Portal, concerned 
Banks/Intermediaries shall be responsible for payment of claims to them 
17.3 
 In order to facilitate timely release of Govt. subsidy and remittance of claims to the farmers. entry 
of detailed information of all insured farmers on NCIP is essential  for all bank branches/PACS/ 
CSCs/Intermediaries/designated insurance agents and Insurance Companies  

## 17.4 **Loanee Farmers (Compulsory Coverage)**

17.4.1 
Whenever banks sanction loan for a notified crop in a notified area, the crop loan amount to the 
extent of notified Sum Insured (equivalent **to DLTC/SLTC approved Scale of Finance)** for notified 
crop and acreage of individual notified crop of loanee farmer shall be taken into consideration for compulsory coverage, as per seasonality discipline. Based on seasonality of crop, banks should separately calculate the eligibility of loan amount for both Kharif and Rabi seasons based on the Scale of Finance and declared acreage under notified crops. Disbursing bank branch/ PACS will prepare statement of crop-wise and insurance unit-wise details of crop insurance with premium as per the 
seasonality discipline. Loan disbursing bank branch/ PACS shall finance additional loan equal to the premium amount payable by farmer for crop insurance. 
17.4.2 
For insurance coverage of a farmer, SI amount for a notified crop will be equivalent to Scale of Finance defined in the Govt. notification and uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal for the concerned notified crop and season. The total Sum Insured of loanee farmer for the season shall be 
calculated accordingly. The compulsory coverage shall solely be based on the sanctioned / renewal of 
credit limit for notified crop for the season only and will be independent of disbursed amount/withdrawals. Farmers availing/renewing the KCC loans for Kharif & Rabi crops after cut-off 
date (renew/sanction period) for the season will be eligible for cover under crop insurance for the next/following crop season subject to the loan being standard loan and cut-off-date of premium debit for the season. In order to eliminate excess insurance and subsequent application of Area Correction 
Factor(ACF), care should be taken by the banks to ensure that only correct acreage under each declared crop in loan application is considered for compulsory coverage of notified crop and not the actual total acreage,. Banks will be liable for audit and inspection on account of excess Insurance/ACF. 
17.4.3 
Benefit of add on products viz., prevented sowing/ on account payment for Mid season adversity/ localized calamity will be available to only those farmers who have paid the premium / the premium has been debited from their account before the damage notification by the State Govt. for invoking 
this provision for compensation. Hence, Banks must ensure that they debit farmers premium within 15 
days from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan, failing which banks will be liable to meet the claim 
liabilities of uncovered eligible famers. Banks are therefore advised to debit loanee farmers premium at least one month before cut-off date for enrolment to avoid this situation and in case sanction happens within one month of cut-off date, banks may daily debit premium for such accounts. 
17.4.4

crop and season.   It shall be the responsibility of ICs to collect the consolidated statement from the concerned bank branches/ PACS. 
17.4.7

transparent and authentic mechanism. Bank branch can upload the details of insured farmers through 
online application mode. Banks are required to upload/enter the information continuously without 
waiting for last day for premium debit and data entry. 
17.4.8

## 17.7 Option For Change Of Crop Name

 Farmers covered, on voluntary basis, can buy insurance before actual sowing/ planting, based on 
advance crop planning. However, for any reason if a farmer changes the crop planned earlier, he should intimate the change to insurance company, up to 2 working days before the cut-off-date for

 Similarly, **loanee farmers** can also change the name of insured crop from the original crop indicated in 
the loan application but such change should be submitted in writing to the concerned bank branch up to 2 working days before cut-off date for enrolment and accordingly their newly proposed crop should be insured. However change of non-notified crop to notified crops without submitting the sowing certificate is not permissible. Bank will ensure that all standard loans (as defined by concerned financial institutions) sanctioned/renewed for notified crops within stipulated cut-off date should 
compulsorily be covered. 
17.8  
Declarations/ proposals and debited premium received by Insurance Companies from the Banks/ 
 
PACS after the cut-off date shall be summarily rejected and the liability, if any, for such declarations

Insurance Portal will also be stopped after the applicable cut off date. However, any dispute in the 
 
matter may be resolved as per the Grievance redressal mechanism detailed in Section 30. 
17.9

on National Crop Insurance Portal or CBS integration module and submit the same within stipulated cut-off date as per the seasonality discipline/ The Banks/ PACS must also ensure the premium amount 
is remitted to the concerned Insurance Company electronically within the stipulated time, failing which they shall be responsible for payment of claims, if any to the farmers. However, any dispute in 
the matter may be referred to the State Govt. by the concerned Agency/Bank for taking appropriate action within the prescribed cut off date for reconciliation of premium by banks with all details.  
17.10  
Insurance companies shall upload requisite information including necessary documentation in respect 
of non-loanee farmers enrolled through channel partner other than CSCs on the National Crop 
Insurance Portal within the stipulated date of coverage of non loanee farmers .All intermediaries shall 
ensure that the documentation is complete in all respect before accepting the premium. It is the responsibility of the concerned Insurance Companies to collect/obtain any documentation of the insured farmers (both loanee and non-loanee) from the bank/financial institutions/ intermediaries/ 
agents if necessary for verification/acceptance of risk and also to facilitate the banks/ financial institutions/ intermediaries/ agents to submit/ upload all requisite documents/information on the National Crop Insurance Portal within timelines. 
17.11  
Insurance Companies should also reconcile the details of individual insured farmers uploaded on the Portal with the premium/consolidated declaration received from each branch/nodal bank within the stipulated date and any deficiency/ mismatch may be reported to concerned bank branch/nodal bank. The Bank Branch/Nodal Bank should further send/upload the requisite information in respect of such 
farmers for whom clarification has been sought, immediately within 7 days.  If such rectification is not done/completed by bank branch /nodal bank within the stipulated period, Insurance Companies may recommend to take necessary action to State Govt. under intimation to Central Govt. State Govt. in consultation with SLBC may recommend suitable administrative action against such defaulting branch/bank. However, claims (if any) in such cases of such farmers shall be borne by the concerned bank only. 
17.12  
Insurance Companies should verify and satisfy themselves about the coverage of farmers/ crops and give acceptance to the applications submitted by banks electronically through National Crop Insurance Portal. The insured farmer's personal details like AADHAAR numbers, Banking Details, Address, mobile nos. and all such details prohibited under RBI, IRDA or UIDAI  Act. shall not be displayed/disclosed 
publicly. Insurance Companies will reconcile the details along with farmer's share of premium receipt before approaching the Govt. to release the final instalment of subsidy (third Instalment) under the 
Scheme. 
17.13  
All Insurance Companies will compulsorily verify and take necessary action including approval/rejection of proposal or policy of any farmer through National Crop Insurance Portal within 
stipulated date.  After stipulated period for reconciliation & obtaining further clarification from 
stakeholders, all pending proposals/information of insured/covered farmers uploaded on Crop 
Insurance Portal will be treated as approved and Insurance Companies will  cease their right for any 
further verification. However, any losses to the Govt. including excess payment of premium subsidy 
due to delayed/non- verification of data/information of individual covered/insured farmers on crop insurance Portal will be recovered from concerned Insurance Companies only. 
17.14  
Banks will ensure distribution of Acknowledgement Receipt along with Folio to each insured farmer within  7 days from the acceptance of applications by the concerned insurance company. The 
Acknowledgement Receipt will be generated through National Crop Insurance Portal itself. 

## 18. Assessment Of Loss / Shortfall In Yield

18.1  
Wide Spread Calamities (based on season-end yield): The Scheme operates on the basis of 'Area 
 
Approach' i.e., Defined Areas for each notified crop for widespread calamities and insurance unit is 
 
Village/Village Panchayat or any other equivalent unit for major crops and for other crops it may be 
 
the same unit or a unit of size higher than Village/ Village Panchayat level, to be decided by the State/ 
 
UT Govt.. State Govt. Department overseeing conduct of CCEs will submit yield data as per cut-off date 
 
decided by SLCCCI, along with results of individual CCEs (conducted through smart phone using CCE 
 
Agri App) on National Crop Insurance Portal. Yield data so arrived at will be approved/ uploaded by 
 
the concerned authority/State nodal department and made available to Insurance Company.  
18.2  
CCEs shall be undertaken per crop per unit area of insurance  for notified crops*,on a sliding scale, as 
 
indicated in Table 4 below: 

| Level                     | Minimum sample size                                            |   Sl.  |

| No.                       |                                                                |        |
| 1                         | District                                                       |    24  |
| 2                         | Taluka/Tehsil/Block                                            |    16  |
| 3                         | Mandal/Firka/Revenue Circle/Hobli or any other equivalent unit |    10  |
| 4                         |                                                                |        |
| Village/Village Panchayat | 4                                                              |        |

 
 
* Minor crops may be notified at higher than Village/Village Panchayat level. 

18.3  
In order to maintain the sanctity and credibility of CCEs as an objective method of yield estimation, the 
 
modalities mentioned below will be followed: 
18.3.1 
 To bring better transparency and confidence in the data, States shall mandatorily ensure 100% CCEs through a mobile application specially designed by Govt. of India for this purpose. No other application shall be used for conducting CCEs. CCE plots for conducting CCEs shall be chosen through random 
selection or preferably using RST and secrecy of the selected plot should be maintained until the CCE is actually conducted in order to rule out moral hazards. 
18.3.2 
 In order to provide proper benefits to the farmers and to compensate them as per near actual loss 
experience, crop should be notified at lowest level i.e. Village/Village Panchayat 
18.3.3 
 State shall strengthen audit process of conduct of CCEs, with necessary checks and balances. Digitizing 
the CCE process including geo-coding (providing the latitude and longitude of the CCE location), date/ time- stamping and taking photographs (of the CCE plot and CCE activity), is a must for all CCEs(para 20.4) 
18.3.4 
 Wherever external agencies are proposed to be used by the State Govts. for conduct of CCEs (i.e. CCEs 
are out-sourced), it should be given only to the registered 'professional/accredited' agencies with 
adequate experience in agricultural field activities/yield estimation. It is mandatory for these agencies to follow the digital protocol as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Services of such agencies may also be utilized for assessment of Post-harvest loss and losses due to localized risks. 
18.3.5 
 States shall maintain same procedure and methodology for conducting CCEs as adopted by NSSO or 
State Manual for Crop Production estimation  

18.3.6 
 District level Steering Committee: State Govt shall compulsorily constitute a Steering committee in 
each district to plan, conduct and supervise the CCEs for yield assessment and to provide reports of 
yield data to the State Nodal department. The Steering committee should be headed by District level Head of Department/Organisation responsible for conducting CCEs. District Agriculture/Cooperative 
officers, representatives of SSO and Insurance Companies shall be members. The Steering committee will compulsorily associate the representatives of Insurance Companies so that they shall be well informed about each and every activity and obtain the requisite information about CCE planning, schedule for conducting CCEs, selection of CCEs plot, sharing of requisite form 2, form 8 etc. and individual CCE result etc. Head of Steering Committee wil be responsible for uploading of all requisite 
information on National Crop Insurance Portal i.e. CCE schedule, individual CCE report etc. and 
imparting training to field functionaries responsible for conducting CCEs. Steering Committee will compulsorily send all their proceedings / minutes etc to DLMC and Nodal officer of the State. Concerned Insurance Companies shall compulsorily deploy one well conversant official at the office of head of Steering Committee for at least 3 months of the harvesting period for better coordination and obtaining the information of CCEs etc. District Administration will provide requisite space and logistics at the office for the insurance company official. 
18.3.7 
 In instances where required number of CCEs could not be conducted due to non-availability of 
adequate cropped area, adverse weather conditions/inadequate infrastructure etc. the yield estimate for such IUs can be generated by using methods such as (i) adopting yield estimate of next higher unit, or (ii) adopting the yield of a neighbouring IU with maximum correlation. Priority of applicability of aforesaid two methods should be notified by the concerned States in the notification itself, failing which option of yield estimate of next higher unit only would be considered. However, this clause shall only be applicable in unavoidable situations and shall be limited to only minimal number of IU units and cannot be made a general rule to avoid CCEs.  Special efforts should be made by the State to conduct adequate no. CCEs in all notified units in order to provide appropriate benefits to farmers.  
18.3.8 
 In case of multi-picking crops e.g. Cotton, Chilly, Tobacco, Tomato, Pea, Fruits (Mango & Apples) & 
other crops of similar nature, following procedure shall be followed. 
18.3.8.1 
 State needs to, in the beginning; specify the number of required picking for each crop both for 
irrigated and un-irrigated conditions. Ideally it should be as per NSSO/IASRI defined guidelines, if it is not available, State in consultation with local Agriculture Universities and concerned ICAR center may 
identify the required number of pickings. However number of actual picking depends on climatic conditions etc. Hence possibility of further pickings of each picking should compulsorily be recorded in 
CCE app and no. of actual picking will be final in such cases. 
18.3.8.2 
If the required number of CCEs have been done and the required number of picking have not being done, then for those experiments, factors need to be used to extrapolate yield to the final yield. 
18.3.8.3 
The factors (proportion of picking wise yield) need to be computed from well conducted CCEs (with the required number of pickings) from the same Taluka separately from Irrigated and Un-irrigated 
condition. At least data of 5 well conducted CCE should be used for computing the factors.   
An Example for Yield Calculation for multi-picking crop is mentioned in Table 5 below:

* 
Total yield has been calculated as the sum of the available picking yields multiplied by the corresponding factor 

18.3.8.4 
In cases there is dispute regarding the large deviation in picking dates the average picking dates should 
be computed from well conducted CCEs in Taluka level. Accordingly the picking dates and number will be adjusted. For example, if the average picking date for second picking in a particular Taluka is in December and one experiment has shown first picking in December it will be considered as second picking. 
18.3.8.5 
If there is no proper CCE (with required number of pickings) in the  Taluka level even, it should be considered as no CCE being available and the procedure defined in yield dispute SOP (Standard 
Operating Procedure) should be followed, i.e. yield should be estimated using remote sensing and 
weather based models. In case the crop has withered and there is no further possibility of having further pickings the same shall be recorded compulsorily in the mobile application/ CCE-Agri App while 
conducting the current picking experiment. In such cases, no multiplication factor may be used for 
calculation of AY.  
The Actual Yield Data at Crop-IU level shall be automatically synchronised with the Portal through online CCE mobile application. Once the Actual Yield data is available on the Portal, the same shall be verified and approved by the concerned District/State authorities.  For those experiments which were conducted offline/without mobile application, the Actual Yield data, along with the location information shall be uploaded by the concerned District administration or State nodal department on the Portal itself. This shall be an exception to be exercised in rare cases and CCEs should not exceed 5% of total CCEs. Actual Yield data through any other mode other than through National Crop Insurance Portal shall not be accepted. If yield data is not uploaded/ synchronised /approved within pre-defined cut-off date by the concerned authority/department, the concerned Insurance Company, may inform State Govt. /Central Govt. well in time for taking appropriate action. 

18.3.8.6 
Insurance Company should be given complete access to co-witness the CCEs, the digital images of the 
CCEs and relevant data in the requisite format (electronic/physical) by the State Govt. on real time basis (Para 35.2.11). A schedule should be formally given/ shared with Insurance Companies 
sufficiently in advance without fail to help them to coordinate with field functionaries and mobilize their manpower accordingly.  For this purpose, Insurance Company shall permanently station one 
representative at the concerned dist office of the dept/ agency mandated to conduct CCEs for proper day to day liaison (Para 18.3.6).  State shall provide necessary space in the concerned office & facilitate 
sharing of information. 

## 19. Dispute Resolution Regarding Yield Data/Crop Loss

19.1 
 It has been seen, during first two years of implementation of PMFBY, there are various types of yield disputes, which unnecessarily delays the claim settlement. Following figure shows the procedures to 
be adopted in various cases. 
 
Figure. Procedures to be followed in different yield dispute cases  

 
19.2 
 Wherever the yield estimates reported at IU level are abnormally low or high vis-à-vis the general crop 
condition the Insurance Company in consultation with State Govt. can make use of various products (e.g. Satellite based Vegetation Index, Weather parameters, etc.) or other technologies (including 
statistical test, crop models etc.) to confirm yield estimates. If Insurance Company witnesses any 
anomaly/deficiency in the actual yield data(partial /consolidated) received from the State Govt., the 
same shall be brought into the notice of concerned State department within 7 days from date of receipt of yield data with specific observations/remarks under intimation to Govt. of India and anomaly, if any, may be resolved  in next 7 days by the  State Level Coordination Committee (SLCC) 
headed by Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned department. This committee shall be authorized to decide all such cases and the decision in such cases shall be final. The SLCC may refer the case to State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) for dispute resolution (Constitution of STAC is defined in Para 19.5). In case the matter stands unresolved even after examination by STAC, it may be escalated to TAC along with all relevant documents including minutes of meetings/records of discussion and report of the STAC and SLCC. Reference to TAC can be made thereafter only in conditions specified in Para 19.7.1 However, data with anomalies which is not reported within 7 days will be treated as accepted to insurance company. The protocol of timelines defined above shall also be applicable to the actual Yield data being provided by the concerned State department in batches, i.e. Crop-wise-District-wise lots of data and timelines for each batch of data shall be counted separately/batch wise. Unnecessary delay in finalization of yield data will attract penal interest on due claim amount payable to the farmers as decided by the SLCC in the matter. 

19.3 
 The existing Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) comprising of representatives from Directorate of 
Economics and Statistics, DAC&FW, MNCFC, NSSO, IASRI,  will be further augmented and  constituted under the chairmanship of **Additional Secretary, DAC&FW** and additional  members depending on 
case to case basis will be drawn from various organizations namely, relevant institution under Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR),  Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Space Applications Centre (SAC), Central Statistical Organization(CSO), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD), India Meteorological Department (IMD) or any other such organisation. 
19.4 
 The role of TAC shall be to review the technical matters related to execution of the Scheme. In case, 
the matter requires further focused deliberations, the TAC will refer the issue to Technical Agency (as defined in the SOP for yield dispute). Technical Agency (TA) will compulsorily take 
input/reports/relevant information from concerned State Department and Insurance Company and may also opt for representatives of other organizations/experts (if required) with permission of chairman of TAC and follow the procedure as defined in the SOP. 
19.5 
 State shall also constitute the State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) on similar pattern to resolve disputes. The STAC may be chaired by the Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned 
department with members from State Agricultural University, State Remote Sensing Centre, IMD (state centre), DES, any ICAR centre in the state, NSSO, etc.). However, in case of disagreement between the concerned parties, the case may be referred to TAC along with recommendations and findings for further deliberation/examination and decision. 
19.6 
 TAC/TA/STAC shall deliberate and examine the subject matter and indicate their views /decisions 
based on statistical/technological inputs and other related scientific and technical parameters as detailed in the SOP. 
19.7 
 The SOP to deal with yield dispute cases is as under: 
19.7.1  
When to use this SOP: This SOP will be followed only when there is a dispute about the crop yield 
values between the State Government and the Insurance Company and this has not been resolved at SLCC level and STAC (Para 19.2) and the matter has been referred to the Central Government 
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which in turn decides that the matter needs to be referred to a Technical Agency (TA). The dispute can be brought to TAC, only in the case, where all of the following 
conditions are satisfied.  All conditions not falling in these criteria shall be decided by SLCC and their 
decision shall be final and binding on all concerned. 
- There is more than 25% difference between the yield estimated by the State government and the 
insurance company. 
- There is sufficient documentary evidence that the CCEs have not been conducted in required 
number and following the standard protocol, in at least 20% area of the IUs for the particular crop in the Cluster.  
- The matter has  been considered by the SLCC and STAC but could not be resolved at State level. 
- The Insurance Company has already carried out technical analysis of data in consultation of State 
Govt. or in collaboration with Central/State agencies and has used satellite/model/weather data to support its claim. 
 
19.7.2 
The Organizations to which TAC can refer the case to: The organizations can be Central Govt. or 
autonomous organizations, which have requisite capacity to carry out such analyses, such as: MNCFC 
(DAC&FW), SAC (ISRO), NRSC (ISRO) and other similar government/non-government organizations (e.g. 
CCAFS-BISA-CGIAR), as decided by TAC. Hereafter, these organizations will be referred to as Technical 
Agencies.  
 
19.7.3 
Data to be provided by State Government:  
- All CCEs data of the contested area, in digital format, (preferably Excel), along with photographs 
and other collateral data, as collected during CCE. The CCE data should be ideally geo referenced.  
- Village level crop area estimates. 
- Long term (at least 10 years) data of crop yield at GP level (if not available, at least at  Taluka/block 
level) in digital format, (preferably Excel)  
- Long term (at least 10 years) data of weather parameters (daily or weekly) at GP level (if not 
available, at least at Taluka /block level). The weather parameters should cover at least, rainfall, rainy days and temperature, in digital format, (preferably Excel) 
- Any information about pest/disease attack, hailstorm, cyclones, inundations, heavy rainfall or any 
other natural/ manmade disasters in that area 
- Report of any analysis carried out by the States to support its claim 
19.7.4 
Data to be provided by Insurance Company:  
- Data of the co-observed CCEs collected by Insurance Companies in digital format, (preferably 
Excel), along with photographs and other collateral data, as collected during CCE 
- Data of weather observatories*, if maintained or sourced by Insurance Companies, in the contested 
area 
- Report of the technical studies* carried out by the Insurance Company to support its claim. 
- Detailed reasons for the yield data being perceived as contested. 
- Any UAV data/output collected from the contested area 
 
(*This data shall only be considered where prior approval for such agency has been taken from State Govt. as outlined in para 2.13) 

## 19.7.5 Analysis To Be Carried Out By The Technical Agency:

 
Among the steps given below, any 3 steps should be followed from a to d and any one step should be followed from e to f. The steps in g and h are compulsory. 
- **Statistical analysis of the CCE yield data**: Basic Statistical Parameters (Mean, Variance, CV, Range, 
Standard Error, etc.)  Scatter plots, Test of Normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, Quartile- Quartile plot, 
Whiskers box plot, Skewness and Kurtosis, etc.). It also needs to be checked whether CCEs were done using the proper sampling design. Village level crop area may also be checked to identify reasons for lower number of CCE. 
- **Analysis of Weather Data**: Weekly Rainfall Deviations (at least at block level) or at grid level using 
gridded or satellite based data, Dry-spell Occurrence, Temperature Anomaly, Soil Moisture Analysis 
(either from satellite or model data) and any other available weather parameters (related to crop condition), either from ground or satellite data. Another rainfall based index, which can also be studied, is Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). SPI can be developed using IMD gridded rainfall data or NOAA CPC rainfall data. However, while using gridded data (either from satellite or ground stations), appropriate resolution should be used at appropriate level. For example, 0.25 degree data should be used only at district level and not at block/village level. High resolution weather data can also be sourced from weather companies.  
- **Analysis of Long-term Yield Data**: Previous 10 years' yield data (at GP or  Taluka level) analysis 
should be carried out to assess the ups and downs. The analysis would include yield ranges, mean yield, standard deviation, and CV. 
- **Analysis of Other collateral data**: Other data or reports, which should be considered, include Crop 
Weather Watch Report, NSSO Supervised CCE data, FASAL programme  crop reports, drought assessment reports prepared by MNCFC, Market arrivals and prices data for 2-3 years 
(http://agmarknet.gov.in/), 
crop 
condition 
data 
available 
on 
VEDAS 
platform 
(https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vedas/), Disaster maps available on Bhuvan platform, IMD weather 
bulletins, weather information/forecasts available on MOSDAC (https://www.mosdac.gov.in/),   
etc. 
- **Analysis of Vegetation Index from Satellite Data:** The vegetation index, which can be used for this 
purpose are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Wetness Index 
(NDWI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition index (TCI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI),  etc. To derive these indices, satellite data of appropriate resolution should be used (Table 6).

However, wherever long-term satellite data is needed MODIS (250 m) data can be used, but it should 
not be used for village level for information.  Ideally for deriving crop specific vegetation indices, crop maps should be overlaid on the data.  Generally for few major crops, crop maps are prepared under 
FASAL project of DAC&FW. Crop maps can be generated using either optical or microwave remote sensing (SAR) data of appropriate resolution.  Wherever, crop maps are not available, at least agricultural area map should be used. For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest 
2-3 years should be used or at least data of a normal crop year should be used.  
- 
Crop Growth Modelling:  Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such as 
DSSAT/ InfoCrop, etc. Remote sensing based semi-physical modelling approach can also be used for crop growth analysis.  However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated models and also models should be run in spatial at higher resolution, at least 5 km.  
- 
Identification of Outliers: All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any reason for yield deviation as presented in the CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared. 
The Yield proxy map can be derived from remote sensing vegetation indices (single or 
combination of indices), crop simulation model output, or an integration of various parameters, which are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite based products, etc. Whatever, yield proxies to be used, it is the responsibility of the organization to record 
documentary evidence (from their or other's published work) that the yield proxy is related to the particular crop's yield.  Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield proxy map. Both 
yield proxy and CCE yield can be divided into 4-5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor, Very poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the CCE yield (more than 2 levels), the CCE yield for that IU can be considered, as outliers.  
- 
Computing Yield for the Outliers: For the IUs, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield 
may be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically significant) between long-term 
yield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote sensing based index data. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated. 
The final yield can be estimated as a combination of CCE Yield and model estimated. The weightage to be given to each estimate will depend upon the quality of each estimate (CCE or Model). Low weightage should be given to CCE not conducted properly (without photograph, geo location, proper sampling plan etc.). Similarly lower weightage to be given model estimates, if model is statistically not highly significant. Wherever, if the model was not statistically significant the average of estimated yields of adjacent blocks should be used (Note: Each and every case may have specific and special cause related to a problem and may not be considered as a reference for any other case.) Each time, the stage of the crop should be given prior importance e.g. 10 mm rainfall at vegetative stage and at harvest or post-harvest stage has different impacts; a small amount rainfall having devastating wind-speed have different impact than high amount of rainfall having calm or no-wind. The Technical Agency needs to take into account all these factors to consider each of the cases as an individual and special case.  

 
19.7.6  
Time required for the analysis: The analysis needs to be completed by the concerned technical 
agency, within one month of receipt of all mentioned data from the Insurance Company and the State Government. 
19.7.7 
Funds needed for the analysis: All the analysis will be carried out by the Technical Agency, with its 
existing resources. However, if there is any need of procurement of priced data or services, this may be funded by the concerned Insurance Agency or the State Government, whichever organization has 
brought the dispute issue up to TAC.  
 
19.7.8 
General Suggestions: Though this SOP identifies the procedure for yield dispute resolutions, in a long 
run, it will benefit the scheme and the farmers, if there is no Dispute. Following suggestions are made 
to avoid dispute. 
- The States should conduct the CCEs following the standard procedure (proper sampling plan) and 
collect the data using Smartphone based Android App 
- States need to pro-actively use technology for more accurate crop yield estimation 
- States should develop mechanism to resolve disputes at State level by technical support from State 
level organizations, such as Agricultural Universities, State Remote Sensing Centres, ICAR Centres located in the State, local IMD office, etc. 
- The Insurance Companies should proactively, get involved with the States for supervision of CCEs. 
- The Insurance Companies should more and more invest in use of technology to support the loss 
assessment. 
- There should be better coordination between the State and the Insurance Companies. 

## 20. Use   Of   Innovative Technologies

20.1 
 To Rationalize CCEs: With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution imaging 
capability orbiting the Earth, there is a great improvement in satellite remote sensing based products. 
It has been reasonably proven that satellite based vegetation indices (such as, Normalized Difference 
Vegetation Index, NDVI and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, NDWI) can help in demarcating the cropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health. This feature can be successfully used to target 
the CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in 'smart sampling' (stratified sampling) of CCEs. This will help in optimizing the number of CCEs, to make them representative of different crop conditions. This is expected to reduce the total need of CCEs by about 
30-40% while maintaining similar accuracy. It will also give a more representative yield of the IU, as it 
will consider all crop pixels (fields) within the IU and not just location of 4 CCEs.  States can adopt this technique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for planning of Crop Cutting Experiments) in generating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For 
using satellite data for smart sampling, there is a need to generate specific crop map. MNCFC under the FASAL project of the DAC&FW prepares crop maps for various crops, as mentioned in Section 25, para 25.4. These crop maps can be used for CCE planning. Vegetation Indices (NDVI and NWDI) need to be computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized into poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be selected randomly. Additionally, ground truthing within these IUs can be done in order to develop crop yield model to ascertain yield estimation of the crop and simultaneously can act as a reconciliation/verification tool of actual CCEs conducted on the field. This can be done in consultation with MNCFC, NRSC (ISRO), SAC (ISRO), SRSC and IASRI. This Department has also been piloting such 
studies, in this regard, for optimization/reduction of crop cutting experiments using technology. 
20.2 
 To remove Area Discrepancy in coverage: It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts, 
area insured is much more than area sown figures hence, compulsory use of RST/ satellite imagery, digitization of land records needs to be done  to minimize the area discrepancy. For this detailed 
procedure has been laid down in section 25 
 

## 20.3 For Direct Yield Estimation

20.3.1 
 For addressing the issue of reliability of CCEs in terms of their accuracy, representativeness and 
timeliness, innovative technologies such as satellite remote sensing, drone, modeling, AWS/ARG,  real 
time transmission of data etc. should be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and 
timely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international organizations, including MNCFC, NRSC, SAC, CCAFS, IRRI, IFPRI, World Bank, etc. have shown that the 
use of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various stages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/ timeliness and support timely claim processing and payments.  
20.3.2 
 States, with the support of national centres as mentioned above, SRSC and SAUs, need to carry out 
adequate number of pilot studies for improved yield estimation using technology, as mentioned 
above, and small number of good quality CCEs. When a significant correlation is observed between remote sensing and weather estimated yield and yield estimated through CCEs, States and Insurance Companies can use these technologies in estimating the crop yields at IU level, subject to the satisfaction of both States and Insurance Companies about the accuracy of the yield estimates, to service the claims. 

## 20.4 To Improve Yield-Data Quality And Timeliness

20.4.1 
 It has been observed that the normall CCE process being followed by the State for estimating yield is 
lacking in reliability, accuracy and speed, which affects claim settlement. There is a need for real 
time, good quality and reliable actual yield-data for which mandatory use of smart phones / hand held devices has to be done for capturing images, location of the CCE and for online transmission of data on 
National Crop Insurance Portal through CCEs Agri-app. RST using satellite and drones, weather data, 
model etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation 
through CCEs. 
20.4.2 
 The cost of using technology etc. for conduct of CCE process specially purchase of smart phones/ hand held devices and use of technology (RST, Drone etc.) will be shared between Central Govt. and State Govts/ U.Ts on 50:50 basis, wherever necessary, subject to a cap on total funds to be made available by Central Govt. for this purpose based on approximate cost of procuring handheld devices/smart phones and other related costs (RST, Drone, etc). 
20.5 
 Technology Fund: A technology fund will be created by GOI wherein resources shall be allocated for meeting 5% of GOI share/100% grant in various technological interventions undertaken by State Govt. funds as admissible. The fund shall be augmented with excess farmers share of premium surrendered 
by Insurance Company due to application of ACF and penalties imposed on Insurance Companies on account of poor performance by Insurance Companies as per the parameters outlined in Annexure 2 

## 21. Assessment Of Claims 21.1 Wide Spread Calamities

21.1.1 
 If 'Actual Yield' (AY) per hectare of insured crop for the insurance unit (calculated on basis of requisite number of CCEs) in insured season, falls short of specified 'Threshold Yield' (TY), all insured farmers growing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall of similar magnitude in yield. PMFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency. 
 
'Claim' shall be calculated at IU level as per the following formula: 
    
  
 
(Threshold Yield - Actual Yield) 
 
                            ———————————————        X     Sum Insured 
         
                                                 Threshold Yield 
 
Where Threshold Yield (TY) for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years from past seven years of that season multiplied by applicable Indemnity Level for that crop 
 

## 21.1.2 Illustration

 
In table below, assumed yield of wheat for the last 7 years is given for insurance unit area of "X". 

Calculation of TY for Rabi 2014-15 season is given in Table 7 below: 

| Year         |   2008-09  |   2009-10  |   2010-11  |   2011-12  |   2012-13  |   2013-14  |   2014-15  |
|--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Yield(kg/ha) |      4500  |      3750  |      2000  |      4250  |      1800  |      4300  |      1750  |

 
The years of 2012-13 and 2014-15 have the lowest yields. 
 
Total of yields of seven years is 22350 kg/ha and that of two lowest yield years is 3550kg/ha 
i.e.(1800+1750). Therefore according to the provision, average of best five years excluding two lowest 
yield years will be (22350–3550=18800/5) i.e. 3760 kg/ha. Hence, threshold yield at 90%, 80% and 70% of indemnity levels will be 3384kg/ha, 3008kg/ha and 2632 kg/ha respectively.

21.2.7.1 
District 'A' has been affected by floods having 100 insurance units under Crop 'X'. Out of which 50 insurance units were severely affected and as per the weather indicators / agro-met data, it has been 
assessed that 30 IUs could have yield loss of more than 50% of the normal yield. Out of these 30 insurance units, estimated yield loss for 5 units is 80% (Category-I), for another 10 units, it is 70% (Category-II) and remaining 15units, it is 60% (Category-III) of normal average yield. As per declarations 
received, if sum insured for notified areas in Category-I, Category-II and Category-III is Rs. 1 crore, Rs. 2 
crore, and Rs 3 crore, respectively, then likely total claims will be Rs. 80 lakh, 140 lakh and 180 lakh, respectively. Hence on-account claims upto 25% shall be Rs.20 lakh, 35 lakh and 45 lakh, which will be

*1) Crop damage should have occurred on account of inundation, mere water logging without corresponding 
crop loss will not be considered  
 
 
2) Inundation peril is not applicable in case of hydrophilic crops like Paddy, Sugarcane Jute & Mesta.  
 
** If affected area is more than 25% of insured area of notified crop in notified insurance unit then the losses are 
not individual but are widespread therefore, all eligible claimant insured farmers would be paid ad-hoc claims for 
localized losses.

22.1.2 
 Once loss assessment/evaluation agency has been empanelled by DAC &FW, it is considered as prequalified company to participate/engage with concerned Insurance Company to undertake loss evaluation/assessment of losses under the provisions of the Scheme, however concerned Insurance 
Company will be responsible for maintaining quality of services being delivered by such agencies. 
22.1.3 
 Once empanelled, the performance of such agencies will be evaluated after two consecutive seasons 
against vital parameters defining service and quality standards as described below by the Committee headed by Joint Secretary/Additional Secretary of DAC&FW and non-performing agencies shall be deempanelled for a period of 2 consecutive seasons. 
22.1.4 
 Detailed guidelines on accreditation of loss assessment agencies shall be prepared by the Committee comprising of members from IASRI, NSSO, MNCFC, Economic and Statistical Advisor-DES, empanelled 
Insurance Company, GIC-Re, representatives from State Nodal Departments etc. These guidelines will enable empanelment/de-empanelment of agencies based on set performance parameters to maintain desired 
quality and standardization of protocols and processes.

localized losses and post-harvest loss events shall be entered by the concerned Insurance Company on 
the Portal. Once the Actual Yield data is available on the Portal, the same shall be verified and 
approved by the concerned District/State authorities.  For those experiments which were conducted offline/without mobile application, the Actual Yield data shall be uploaded by the concerned District administration or State nodal department on the Portal itself.  
23.4 
 The loss reports and Actual Yield data shall be approved/reverted (in case of any discrepancy/concern 
on the authenticity/correctness of report/data) by the Insurance Company based on which the eligible claims shall be calculated through the Portal and accordingly the payment of claims shall be initiated 
by the concerned Insurance Company and remitted directly into beneficiary account as per predefined timelines. The application wise payment details viz. amount, reference number, date etc. shall be entered/ synchronised with the National Crop Insurance Portal for future reference and audit purpose. 
23.5 
 In case of widespread calamity (end of season claims), once yield data is received/finalized from State 
Govt. as per the cut-off-dates decided, claims will be worked out on the National Crop Insurance Portal 
as per declarations/ approved proposals & covered farmer's data received from banks / channel partners / insurance intermediaries for each notified area and crops and accordingly the claims will be 
approved by Competent Authority of implementing Insurance Company. 
23.6 
 In case of farmers covered through Financial Institution, claims shall be released only through electronic transfer directly into insured farmer's given bank account, followed by details containing 
claim particulars, to individual bank branches/ nodal banks; Bank Branch should also display particulars 
of claim disbursal on notice board to enable spread of awareness and inclination amongst farming community for risk mitigation through crop insurance. Insurance Company is required to compulsorily upload the claim details against each insured farmer on National crop insurance Portal. 

23.7 
 In case of farmers covered on voluntary basis through intermediaries, payable claims will directly be 
credited to the bank accounts of concerned insured farmers and details of the claims may also be 
intimated to them. The list of beneficiaries shall also be uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal 
immediately. 
23.8 
 In case of claims under prevented/failed sowing, localized calamities, post- harvest losses; Insurance 
Company will process the claims after assessment and shall release the claims as per detailed 
procedure given in the relevant sections above. 
23.9 
 The claim settlement intimation shall be sent to each beneficiary farmer through SMS from the Portal 
itself. State Govts, Banks & Insurance companies shall ensure correctness of data before hand viz. 
Threshold Yield, Actual Yield, Insured Area, Sum Insured and Indemnity levels etc. Responsibility of any 
error, omissions and mis-reporting shall lie with the concerned State Nodal Department and insurance Company. State Govt. & Insurance Companies shall resolve all the grievances of the insured farmers 
and other stakeholders in the shortest possible time. 
23.10 
 In any situation, State Govt. can not reopen/ re calculate claims after 30 days of claims settlement for notified crop(s) at notified unit. Disputed claims / sub-standard claims , if any, due to erroneous data  
may be referred within this time to SLCC/STAC and further to Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), if 
required, for consideration and decision  

## 24. Important Conditions /Clauses Applicable For Coverage Of Risks

24.1 
 Insurance companies should have received the premium for coverage either from bank, channel 
partner, insurance intermediary or directly. In case of any loss in transit due to negligence by these 
agencies or non remittance of premium by these agencies, the concerned bank/intermediaries shall be liable for payment of claims. 
24.2 
 In case of any substantial misreporting by nodal bank /branch in case of compulsory farmers 
coverage, the concerned bank only shall be liable for such mis-reporting. 
24.3 
 Mere sanctioning/ disbursement of crop loans and submission of proposals/ declarations and 
remittance of premium by farmer/bank, without explicit intent to raise the crop, does not constitute acceptance of risk by Insurance Company. 
 

## 25. Acreage Discrepancy

25.1 
 Some areas in the past have reported excess insurance coverage vis-à-vis planted acreage, leading to overinsurance.  Ideally the discrepancy should be handled at farm level to protect the interest of farmers 
with genuine insurance coverage. All suitable measures are being taken by concerned stakeholders for 
de duplication with the help of Aadhaar Number, land records, banks records, revenue records and proposal/loan application of insured farmers. The details of individual insured farmers are being 
collected on National Crop Insurance Portal for de duplication. However, in the absence of digitized farm records on a GIS platform and its integration with the Portal, it would be cumbersome to 
physically verify each farm when the reported discrepancies are comparatively large compared to the 
sown areas.  Moreover, the scheme also covers the risk of prevented sowing/germination failure which 
is not being included in sowing areas furnished by the State Government for arriving of sown area of 
crop the during the season. State wise List of such major crops will be notified by DAC&FW in 
consultation with MNCFC from time to time before beginning of every season.  
25.2 
 Under the scheme, notified crops are being insured by the Insurance companies on the basis of actuarial premium rate, hence, it is not their prerogative to reduce the Sum Insured and resultant 
claims on the application of ACF. However, to rationalize the government subsidy, it the 
responsibilities of all concerned stakeholders including farmers and financial institutions to insured the crop which farmer actually intend to sow/actually sown.  Option to change the insured crop has also 
been provided under the scheme for reporting of crop(s) actually sown for the insurance. There is 
also a provision to indemnify the crop losses due to localized perils on the basis of survey of individual plot/field under insured crops. Any wrong reporting of insured crops may lead to forfeiting of claims, if the crop actually sown and insured will be different.     
 
25.3 
 Area Discrepancy will be applied only to those major crops for which Normal area sown data at the 
Block/Taluka level shall be provided by MNCFC based on the remote sensing data etc after factoring the areas remains unsown and failed germination/plantation due to adverse climatic conditions  and shall be made available on National Crop Insurance Portal. No other data from any source including 
State Govt. will be considered.  
25.4 
 However, any mass irregularities/anomalies in insuring of excess area i.e. more than the published 
cultivable area at Taluka level should compulsorily be brought to the notice of DAC&FW, in writing after cut off date of enrolment but before the period specified for reconciliation with banks along with facts/documents and list of bank branches etc so that the same may be examined by the Government and rectified by concerned bank itself before finalisation of business Statistics for the season on Portal  
25.5 
 Decision of GOI in applicability of discrepancy in insured area shall be binding on all. 
25.6 
 If the difference between insured area and sown area provided by MNCFC  is >30% at Block/Tehsil/ 
Taluka , all IUs of such Block/Tehsil/ Taluka will fall under acreage discrepancy category and should be treated as having 'excess' insurance coverage.  
25.7 
Data on application of ACF shall be uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal.  
25.8 
 Accordingly excess insured area shall be treated as un-insured and corresponding farmer's premium 
will be forfeited and the same will be surrendered to Technology Fund of GOI and may be utilized for 
leveraging technology in PMFBY for improvement of technology/research/Impact assessment etc and 
towards assistance to States for cost of incremental CCEs  
25.9 
 Premium subsidy refunded by ICs due to application of ACF shall be refunded to Central/State Govt. in ration of 50:50   

## 26. Publicity And Awareness

26.1 
 Adequate publicity needs to be given in all the villages of the notified districts/areas. All possible means of electronic and print media, farmer's fair, exhibitions, SMS, short films, and documentaries 
shall be utilized to create and disseminate awareness about provisions and benefits of the Scheme among the cultivators and the agencies involved in implementing the Scheme. Agriculture/ Cooperation Departments of the State shall work out appropriate plan for awareness generation and publicity on an on-going basis from **three months** prior to the start of coverage period. Similarly, 
Insurance Companies will conduct Publicity and Awareness immediately on receipt of award of work. All the publicity material/ information should necessarily be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal along with coverage/frequency/ duration date etc. 
26.2 
 The State Govt./ UT in collaboration with Insurance Companies shall also chalk out plan for capacity building of the associated agents, banks etc for effective implementation of the Scheme and organize 
training workshops/ sensitization programme for them in association with participating Insurance Companies. 
26.3 
 Insurance company should spend 0.5% of the total gross premium for publicity expenses at the field 
level and the corresponding details should be submitted to GOI and State govt. at the end of every 
season. In case of expenditure in this category is less than 0.5% of Total Gross Premium, the IC shall deposit the difference in Technology fund within 3 months of cut off date for enrolment. 

## 27. Service Charges 27.1 To Banks

27.1.1 
Bank and other financial institutions etc. shall be paid service charges @ 4% of the farmer's share of premium by Insurance Company as generated from the Portal and within the 15 days of finalization of business statistics. Rural agents engaged in providing insurance related services to farmers may be paid appropriate commission as decided by Insurance Company, subject to cap prescribed under IRDAI 
regulations. If there is delay in payment of service charges by Insurance Company beyond 15 days of 
finalization of business statistics, amount needs to be paid with interest @12% p.a. 
27.1.2 
Even if the farmer's share of premium is contributed/financed by the concerned State Govt. the 
applicable service charges shall be paid by the concerned Insurance Company only. 
27.1.3 
No service charges will be payable to the concerned bank/branch for the applications for which any 
anomaly/deficiency/misrepresentation of details/data is found.  

27.2 
To CSC & Other Intermediaries: 
27.2.1 
Common Service Centres shall be paid service charges by Insurance Companies, as decided by GOI, per 
farmer application form successfully submitted by them. This includes charges for submission of

## 28. Goods & Service Tax (Gst)

28.1 
 Collection of premium under the Scheme is exempted from applicability of Goods & Service Tax (GST)  

## 29. Monitoring And Review Of The Scheme

29.1 
 State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI) of the concerned State will be 
responsible for monitoring of the Schemes/programme in its State. However, a National Level 
Monitoring Committee (NLMC) under the chairmanship of Secretary, DAC & FW will monitor the Scheme at the national level. 
29.2 
 It is proposed to take following monitoring measures for effective implementation during each crop season to ensure maximum benefits to the farmers: 
29.2.1 
 The Bank branches/CSCs/ intermediaries may collect the details of individual insured farmers (both loanee and non-loanee) like name, fathers' name, Bank Account number, Aadhaar number village, 
categories - small and marginal/SC/ST/women, insured acreage, insured crop(s), sum insured, 
premium collected, Govt. subsidy etc and submit electronically using web form or CBS Integration module along with electronic submission of crop wise consolidated declarations on or before final cutoff date.. Yield data based on CCEs shall be made available online on National Crop Insurance Portal to the concerned Insurance Company by the State Govt. within a month from the date of final harvest of 
individual crop. 
29.2.2 
 Calculation of ACF if any shall be made immediately after receipt of insured acreage and sown area data but not later than the onset of CCEs similarly any anomaly in the actual yield data shall immediately be brought into the notice of concerned State Govt. and not later than 15 days from final receipt of actual yield data as detailed in section 25. 
29.2.3 
 Insurance Companies shall calculate crop-wise, IU wise payable claims based on the actual yield data 
and threshold yield given at the time of tendering. Accordingly the payable claims subject to payment 
of full premium share by the Central and State Govt for the season shall be remitted by the Insurance Companies directly into benefitted farmer's accounts electronically, payment details for which shall be updated on the National Crop Insurance Portal on daily basis. 

29.2.4 
 After receiving the claims amount from the concerned Insurance Companies, the financial institutions/banks should display the list of the beneficiaries/details of claims (both loanee and nonloanee) on the notice board of the branch within seven days with details of beneficiaries like Name of farmers/beneficiaries, crops insured, sum insured, amount of claims received etc.  
29.2.5 
 The list of beneficiaries (Bank-wise and insured area-wise) shall also be uploaded/ placed on  the website of the concerned Insurance Companies with proper provisions and mechanisms of public grievance redressal/feed-back etc. State Govts./UT should ensure that crop insurance products 
provide comprehensive insurance coverage to the farmers on sound insurance principles and provide 
the best value for the premium. State Govt. may also review the progress of Scheme periodically and undertake impact assessment after the completion of each season and send their suggestion/ recommendations to this Department for making further improvements in the Scheme. 
29.2.6 
 About 5% of the beneficiaries may be verified by Regional Offices/Local level Offices of ICs who will send the feedback to concerned DLMC and State Govt./SLCCCI on Crop Insurance. 
29.2.7 
 At least 10% of the beneficiaries verified by the IC may be cross verified by the concerned DLMC and they should send the feed back to State Govt. 
29.2.8 
 1 to 2% of the beneficiaries may be verified by the Head Office of the IC/Independent Agencies appointed by the Central Govt./NLMC and they should send the necessary feed back to Central Government. 

## 30. Grievance Redressal Mechanism-

30.1 
At the initial level, for grievance redressal, each district shall designate district level grievance redressal officer preferably **District Agri Officer** to respond to the grievances of Farmers, Banks, ICs etc. within 7 
days of receipt of grievance. In case of dissatisfaction the matter may be brought before District Level Grievance Redressal Committee (DGRC)  
30.2 
 District Level Grievance Redressal Committee (DGRC): a district level monitoring Committee shall act as a grievance redressal Committee for redressal of grievances of Farmers, Banks, Insurance Company, District Authority/Department. This Committee will be headed by District Magistrate/Collector and representatives of Farmers, LDM/Banks, DDM NABARD, Insurance Company and concerned District Authority/Department shall be appointed as members. This Committee may also invite subject specialists/experts from University/IMD/commodity Boards/Research Institutions, SRSC etc. if deemed 
necessary. The Committee will dispose the matter within 15 days. The decision of the Committee shall be accepted by all the parties and in case of disagreement with the decision; the same shall be 
represented to the State Level Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC) within 15 days from the decision of DGRC. In case the DGRC doesn't take the matter for discussion within7 days from 
submission of grievance or the grievance has wider scope of effect impacting more number of districts or there is a breach of guidelines by any of the stakeholder or the grievance matter exceeds Rs. 25 Lakh in monetary terms, the matter may be directly raised at State Level Grievance Redressal Committee. 

30.3 
 State Level Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC): a State level monitoring Committee shall act as a 
grievance redressal Committee for redressal of grievance of Farmers, Banks, Insurance Company, District Authority/Department which does not get settled at DGRC. This Committee will be headed by 
Principal Secretary/Secretary of Nodal Department , SLBC/Banks, CGM NABARD, Insurance Company

## 31. Empanelment And Selection Of Insurance Companies 31.1 Empanelment Criteria

31.1.1 
 The Public Sector (AIC& others) and Private Sector General Insurance Companies empanelled by DAC & FW and selected by concerned State Govt. / Union Territory (UT) shall implement the PMFBY. The 
Insurance Companies mainly engaged in agriculture/rural insurance business and having adequate experience, infrastructure, financial strength and operational capabilities are empanelled by DAC&FW. Once Insurance Company has been empanelled by DAC &FW, it is considered as pre-qualified 
company to bid for the selection of Implementing Agency (IA) to undertake implementation of the Scheme/Programme of DAC&FW.  
31.1.2 
 L1 bidder shall not be permitted to surrender partial clusters/districts. If any Insurance Company declines after being declared L1,  it will be de-empanelled/ de-barred to implement crop insurance Scheme for 
the coming/next season(s) in the concerned State and L2 may be given the cluster for implementing 
the crop insurance Scheme at L1 district-crop combination rates and so on to L3, L4 bidder with their consent. All Such bidders will be required to simultaneously furnish appropriate reasons for withdrawal/surrender/non acceptance in writing to State Govt. with copy to DAC&FW to enable further corrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action accordingly. Financial losses, if any, to the State Govt., in retendering due to withdrawal of selected bidders, will be recovered from withdrawing 
L1 bidder. 
31.1.3 
 Tender should be  preferably for 3 years and in no case less than  1 year  
31.1.4 
 Each Insurance Company should compulsorily bid for any 3 NER/Hilly States and 2 UTs 
 

## 31.2 Selection Criteria Of Insurance Companies As Implementing Agency (Ia)

31.2.1 
 The selection of Insurance Company from the empanelled Insurance Companies to act as Implementing Agency (IA) shall be done by the concerned State/UT Govt. for implementation of the Scheme in their State. Selection of IA will be made by adopting the cluster approach. In case of smaller 
States, the whole State may be assigned to one IA. 
31.2.2 
 Before the commencement of the crop season, State Govt. would invite the pre-qualified companies 
as mentioned in the preceding para through open tender for submission of district-wise and cropwise actuarial premium rates in percentage of Sum Insured (financial bid). Indemnity Level, 
Threshold Yields, Sum Insured etc. will be same for all Insurance Companies for the season. The empanelled companies participating in bidding have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notified / to be notified in the cluster by the State Govt. and non-compliance will lead to rejection of the bid. 
31.2.3 
 Based on the district-wise and crop-wise actuarial premium rates quoted by the pre-qualified 
companies, the total premium amount and weighted average premium rates for cluster of districts will be worked out to arrive at L1. L1 Bidder will be selected to act as Implementing Agency in the concerned cluster. 
31.2.4 
 Selection of IA may be made for at least 1 year or up to three years as mentioned above Such long 
term continuity will facilitate the Insurance Company to establish the credibility among the farmers through investment out of the premium savings in various welfare activities for socio-economic 
development of the farmers like creation of the facilities of drinking water/ healthcare/education, farm levelling, Weather Forecasts, CSCs etc. It is also anticipated that long term continuity gives an opportunity to Insurers, Bankers, State Govt. and other stakeholders for a supportive and collaborative interaction and business relationship and service effectiveness.  
31.2.5 
 The insurance coverage in terms of number of farmers and acreage should be at least at the level of 
corresponding previous season.  In case of fall in coverage, GOI may get the facts examined and necessary action including penal action against negative points in ranking for ICs and State Govt., if found at fault may be taken by GOI.   
31.2.6 
 State Govt. may provide requisite data about past yield data of last 10 consecutive years or more, 
threshold yield, crop-wise sum insured, indemnity level, insurance unit levels, names of notified units, 
calamity years etc. in digital form by uploading the same on National Crop Insurance Portal itself before floating the formal tender notice. 

## 32. Clustering /Clubbing Of Districts For Bidding By The State

 
In order to diversify/ spread the risk and cover high risk/ low risk districts/ area equally, the State Government are required to group the districts/ area in such a way that each group contains mix of 
districts/ area with different risk profiles. Prior to inviting the bid, the State Government specially large 
State have to divide the State in to multiple clusters of districts depending upon  volume of risk associated in the crops and district/areas proposed to be notified under the Scheme. The purpose of 
clustering is to divide the States into different groups of districts, so that expected sum insured (ESI) becomes low and risk is shared and diversified. States may form the clusters of districts based on 
mixed agro-climatic zones. i) Districts of high risk and low risk areas, ii) districts of different agroclimatic zones, and iii) ESI is of each cluster should be of similar order.  
 
Prior to the bid invitation, details on the clusters formation may also be made available to the Insurance Companies. 

## The Object Of Clustering/ Clubbing Of Districts Should Be Done To Achieve The Following Objectives:

- 
Cluster formation may be applicable for upto 3 years.  
- 
Different Clusters may be defined based on risk profile of the district so as to increase the diversification of risk within a cluster and enable risk spreading for insurer. 
- 
Cluster may contain districts with mixed agro-climatic zones so as to increase the diversification of 
risk within a cluster. 
- 
Crop wise associated risk may also be diversified among the clusters and shall be factored in 
cluster formation. 
1. 
Hence, one of the major requirements of clustering is risk analysis of different districts.  As per 2016 Guidelines of PMFBY, for the purpose of clustering/clubbing of districts and determination of L1 
bidder, the risk is analyzed based on long term data of yield by (a) computing average burn cost 
(percent difference between actual yield and threshold yield) and b) computing the level of variability in long term yield. Since, availability of high quality long term yield data is difficult, especially at lower administrative level, other methods (including use of satellite data) can be tried for risk assessment. 
2. 
 Satellite data, of moderate resolution (e.g. Resourcesat AWiFS, Terra/Aqua MODIS) are available, for long term, i.e. at least around 15 years. The long term Vegetation Indices, which are indicators of crop health, derived from these satellites can be used to assess the year to year variations and thereby understanding the risk potential of an area. It can be combined with many other satellite derived products, such as flood maps, drought assessments and vulnerability and long term weather data to carry out the risk analysis. States are advised to take the support of concerned national or State level research organizations (e.g. ISRO- NRSC/SAC, MNCFC, SRSC, SAUs, etc.), to use the above mentioned 
technology for carrying out risk analysis of the Districts/ Talukas/ Blocks towards improvement in 
clustering. 
3. 
 These are only for guidance of States and States are free to follow either of these or any other method 
devised by them with intimation to DAC&FW. 
4. 
 The detail illustration for classification of risks, clubbing/clustering of risks and districts and 
determination of L1 bidder are at Annexure 1. 

## 33. Assessment Of Performance And De-Empanelment Of Insurance Companies

33.1 
 The performance of the empanelled Insurance Companies shall be closely monitored by DAC & FW on 2 years interval through ascertaining the company's skills and efficiencies for providing cost effective better insurance services to farmers. For the purpose, a detailed performance evaluation matrix containing key performance indicators with assigned weightage has been worked out and is as given at Annexure 2. 

## 34. Evaluation Of Efficiency Of Nodal Department Of The State

34.1 
 The efficiency evaluation of the State Nodal Department shall also be closely monitored by DAC & FW on every 1 year interval through ascertaining the State's efficiency and execution / implementation of the Scheme. For the purpose, a detailed performance evaluation matrix containing key performance indicators with assigned weightage has been worked out and is as given at Annexure 3.

## 36. National Crop Insurance Portal For Administration Of Crop Insurance Program (Www.Pmfby.Gov.In)

36.1 
  
The Govt. is endeavouring to integrate all stakeholders' viz. farmers, Insurance Companies, 
financial institutions and Govt. agencies on single IT platform to ensure better administration, coordination and transparency for getting real time information and monitoring in a phased manner.  
36.2 
 The idea behind developing a web-based, integrated IT solution is to speed up service delivery, unify 
fragmented databases, achieve a single view of data, eliminate manual processes and thus provide faster insurance services to farmers. DAC&FW has designed a web Portal for crop insurance 
(www.pmfby.gov.in) and is doing further enhancements to provide a single IT enabled platform for 
digitization of processes and information data bank and dissemination mechanism, automation of administrative procedures, premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system is 
envisaged to address the issues which affect the current system of programme administration and thereby reduce its efficacy and lead to denial/ delay in benefit transfer to farmers viz. selective/layered information 
access, manual interventions, multi-step procedures, documentary evidence/proofs, delayed/defective 
information sharing. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State Govts. and 
yield/weather data providers with National Crop Insurance Portal directly or through interface for fetching 
in information is felt essential to avoid errors for timely transmission of requisite information amongst major stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper monitoring and transparent administration of the 
Schemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web Portal is established, it 
would also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic flow of information. Currently, this Portal is 
available in two languages - Hindi and English and it will be converted into all regional languages. 
36.3 
 The aforesaid Portal will provide an integrated ecosystem to streamline the process and to automate administrative functions. A web-based, integrated IT solution has been developed which has opened a 
window of opportunity to remote and economically-weak farmers to benefit from crop insurance 
services. 
36.4 
 The conceptualisation and development of web-portal has already been completed and launched 
however development and integration of futuristic technologies and enhancements as defined below 
are envisaged to be initiated in coming months.  
36.4.1 
 Payment of Premium and Remittance of Claims through Payment Gateway: All premium remittance 
from Farmers/Banks/Intermediaries and claim remittance from Insurance Companies will be routed through the Portal using payment gateway Pay-Gov. The facility is envisaged to address reconciliation 
of funds and bring swiftness and transparency in claim settlement. 
36.4.2 
 Integration of National Crop Insurance Portal with IT infrastructure of Insurance Company: For 
seamless and real-time data flow of following stages to the Insurance Companies, direct integration of 
National Crop Insurance Portal with the IT system of respective Insurance Companies will be 
established. The information/data will be shared in encrypted form over secure data exchange platform. 
- 
Farmer's enrolment and premium remittance,  
- 
Information and reports regarding mid-term/preventive sowing/individual/localized claims and  
- 
AY/TY data for final claim calculation and remittance of claims into farmer's bank account. 
 
36.4.3 
 Integration of Digital Land Records: Various State Govts. are working on digitization of land records 
and providing facility to land owners to identify and take records of land parcels owned by them. The same digitized land records will be mapped with the codes used in National Crop Insurance Portal followed by online integration of the individual land records with the crop insurance application. This facility will address the issue of excess insurance/double insurance and application of ACF which is 
prevalent currently. 
36.4.4 
 Integration of Weather Data with the Portal: Weather Data procured from a network of Automatic 
Weather Stations and Automatic Rain Gauges across the country will be procured from IMD and 
integrated with the National Crop Insurance Portal. This will enable real-time monitoring of weather 
parameters, agro-climatic inputs, crop health monitoring, triggers for preventive sowing/mid-term adversities etc. This integration will also facilitate faster, transparent transmission of yield/weather data to concerned Insurance Companies and automated claim  calculation and remittance to 
beneficiaries. This feature will ensure availability of real-time information about crop loss and payable 
claims vis-a-vis necessary triggers/inputs to Govt. agencies/Implementing agencies so that policy 
decisions/administrative corrective measures can be taken. 
36.4.5 
 Integration of Public Grievance Redressal Module: For bringing efficiency in addressing the grievances 
of farmers and other stakeholders, a system for registration of complaints and grievances, escalations and resolution will be integrated with the Portal.   
36.4.6 
 Launch of National Help Line and Integration with Web-Portal: A quick response system is very 
crucial for creating trust and bringing behavioural changes and efficiency amongst the stakeholders. Keeping the same in view, an integrated help line of Kisan Call Center will be launched for benefit of all the stakeholders for query resolution, technical handholding and specific information dissemination. 
36.4.7 
 Development of Mobile-App for Localized/Individual, Preventive/Mid-Term Loss Assessment and 
reporting: For bringing in swiftness and accuracy in the information sharing and reporting of Localized/Individual, Preventive/Mid-Term Losses, a mobile application will be launched for use of loss 
assessors/DLMC members. This data collected through app will be immediately sent to National Crop Insurance Portal which will be accessed by all the stakeholders. This will help in monitoring and faster 
analysis and claim settlement. 
36.4.8 
 Integration of Interest Subvention Scheme with Crop Insurance: A web-portal for Interest Subvention 
Scheme is also being developed for monitoring and implementation of ISS. This Portal will be interlinked with the National Crop Insurance Portal for automatic enrolment of eligible farmers and deduction of applicable premium. This will also enable de-duplication of KCC/seasonal Crop Loans and provisioning of services 
36.4.9 
 Integration of RST/Satellite Data for handling Data Discrepancy/dispute resolution: New Age 
Technologies like Remote Sensing Technology is a promising step in bringing in procedures and 
systems of approach which is more reliable, accurate and fast in resolving errors/concerns of stakeholders and provide a progressive and scientific solution which the traditional/existing procedures and practices are unable to provide. This will help in reduction in time required for collection and collation of different data sets and reports pertaining to crop health, productivity, sowing and harvesting activities. 

36.4.10 
 MNCFC data Integration on Portal: To streamline the flow of information amongst stakeholders, the 
portal will also be integrated with the system/data being developed by MNCFC on aforesaid aspects. 
36.4.11 
Evaluation & Management Information System (E &MIS) for all stakeholders with secured credential: For monitoring progress of the Scheme, a stakeholder specific customized MIS is also being 
developed, which will help in monitoring, application creation, notification status, CCE status etc. to give a summarised overview of different stages of the Scheme. 
36.4.12 
Data repository for risk classification and risk mitigation: For the purpose of risk estimation, a 
repository is being created which will contain IU wise average yield of insured crops for past decade and weather data at the level of automatic weather station to analyse crop wise risk calculation before season starts. This repository will be updated regularly for yield data and weather data.

## Iii. Define Coverage Level

a) **Estimation of the Area Insured (in ha):** The area insured for the ensuing season would be 
estimated on the basis of previous years the districts within State based on the fair judgment. The State Government would project area insured for the ensuing season for each district-crop 
combination. 

## Illustration: For District 1 With Two Crops Would Be Estimated

* Targeted penetration percentage (%) can be decided according to the associated potentiality of the district and other relevant parameters. 

b) **Estimated area insured for current season-year** will be multiplied with sum insured (Rs. /ha) 
to arrive the Expected Sum Insured (in Rs.) for each and every district-crop combination. The 
district level Expected Sum insured (ESI) will be the total of each district-crop combination 
within the districts.

c) In the similar manner calculate Expected Sum Insured (ESI) in Rs. for all the districts. 
d) Calculate1/3and2/3Percentile values of Expected Sum Insured (ESI) for entire district within 
State. Define Coverage Level as per following percentile values: 
 

| Coverage Level       | Percentile                                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Low                  | District ESI < 1/3 percentile value             |
| Medium               | District ESI >= 1/3 and < 2/3 percentile values |
| High                 | District ESI >= 2/3 percentile value            |
|                      |                                                 |
| 1/3 percentile value | 3500000 = PERCENTILE(DistrictESI,1/3)           |
| 2/3 percentile value | 8833333 = PERCENTILE(DistrictESI,2/3)           |
| 1/3 percentile value    | 3500000 = PERCENTILE(DistrictESI,1/3)    |

| Medium Risk | High Coverage   |                 2 |         |
| Low Risk    | High Coverage   |                 3 |         |
| High Risk   | Medium Coverage |                 4 |         |
| Medium Risk | Medium Coverage |                 5 |         |

| Low Risk    | Low Coverage    |                 9 |         |

e)  Allocation of codes to different districts: 
- 
Arrange the districts in any order. 
- 
Write risk level and coverage level corresponding to each district. 
- 
On the basis on above code table allot codes to each district. 
- 
Arrange the districts in ascending order of allotted codes. 
- 
Write ESI against each district in next column and arrange ESI in descending order of the district within the same code.

For other codes, the distribution may be done to achieve balancing of ESI. 

f) Make suitable minor changes in the distribution of districts to clusters for achieving the 
objective of clustering. 

## Applicable Conditions For Clustering/ Clubbing Of Districts:

i. 
Within the cluster Insurance Companies would be required to quote premium rates for all district-crop combination for their bids to be evaluated. 
ii. 
Company not quoting even for one of the total district-crop combinations within the cluster 
would be disqualified for the bidding period. 
iii. 
There would be no further negotiations with the L1 bidder to accept L1 rates of other bidder 
for any district crop combination i.e. the rates quoted by the L1 bidder for different districtcrop combination would be applicable within the cluster. Bidding and negotiation conditions 
will be as per CVC guidelines vide its circular nos. No.005/CRD/012 dated 03rd March 2007 & 
No.005/CRD/012 dated 20th Jan 2010. 
iv. 
L1 bidder shall not be permitted to surrender partial clusters/districts. If any company declines 
after being declared L1, the company may be barred to implement crop insurance scheme for the coming 1 season in the concerned State and the L2 may be given the cluster for implementing 
the 
crop 
insurance 
scheme 
at 
L1 
district-crop 
combination 
ratesandsoontoL3,L4bidderaspertheconsentofinsurancecompany. Such bidders will be required 
to furnish appropriate reasons for withdrawal/surrender in writing to Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer's Welfare, Govt. of India within 10 days from opening of the bids to enable further corrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action against defaulting bidders.

L1 in Cluster1 is company (Z). Similar process would be followed other clusters. 

 
 Method 2 
 
Agriculture output in the area/ district is influenced by the agro-climatic conditions of that area/district. On the basis of the variation in agriculture output (crops) in each district during the last 10 years, districts may be divided in to three categories of low, moderate and high risks to agriculture. 

If variation in agriculture output in the district during the last 10 years worked out to be plus minus<15% then district may be categorized as low risk. Similarly, districts of variation ranging plus minus 16-30% may be categorized of moderate risks and variation of plus minus >30% as high risks districts to agriculture operations. Accordingly all districts of the State would be identified as low/moderate/high risk. Number of clusters to be formed shall be decided according to total no. of districts in the State. Total no. of each category of low, moderate and high risks districts shall be divided by no. of clusters to be formed in the State. Then, equal no. of low risk districts shall be selected randomly for each cluster of districts. Similarly, moderate and high risks districts would be selected. 

 
Example: 
 
State– UP, No. of districts - 75 
 
Basedonthelast10yearsvariationinoutput, category-wise No. of districts identified: 
 
Low risks 40, Moderate risks 20, High risks 15, 
 
No. of clusters (of preferably 15-20 districts each) to be formed:   75/19 =3.95 say4 
 
Then, no. of low risks districts in each cluster: 40/4 = 10 
Similarly, moderate risks districts: 20/4=5 and high risks districts: 15/4=3.75 say 4 As such, 
 
Sample calculation to find L1:

| No. of high     |                          |                 |
| risks districts | in cluster               |                 |

Remarks on Points criteria 
Rationale With a view to ensure well worked out rational rating practice and 
professional handling of bids 
If bids are withdrawn by the Insurance Company: a) 1 cluster/state    : 5 Points b) > 1 cluster/State : 15 Points Additionally, financial losses, if any, to the State Govt., in retendering due to withdrawal of selected bidders and additional premium subsidy due to increase in actuarial premium rates from previously declared L1 rates, will be recovered from withdrawing L1 bidder. 
To increase coverage under the Scheme 
1.      If company-wise at all India 
level coverage of Non-Loanee farmers decreases by: (a)   < 25%  :  5 Points (b)   >25%   : 10 Points 2.      If target of enrolment of non 
loanee farmers not achieved in the bidded cluster(s), -1% of Gross premium of such clusters would be forfeited as penalty and shall be 
deducted from final instalment of premium subsidy.
