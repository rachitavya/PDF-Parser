1344,508.0,"1.3 To promote financial literacy among the farmers and school children, NABARD Chhattisgarh RO engaged the Farmers Club Federations and provided financial assistance. Initially 10 awareness programmes and 20 quiz programmes were sanctioned for Bilaspur and Mungeli districts and organized by the Farmer Club Federations (FCF). As the federations and farmer clubs are village level bodies and have local presence and acceptance, they could mobilize children and their parents in good numbers. Looking at the encouraging results, the RO sanctioned more awareness and quiz programmes at different times thereafter. This provided much needed scope for interaction between the DDM, Farmer Federations, bank officials and the Government officials which paved way for making the federations financially sustainable entities.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Financial Literacy Through Farmers Clubs",,,117,input/md/english\FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

As on September 2014, 16 kiosks were working through three farmer club federations. SBI was in the process of establishing 14 more Kiosks at other village centres in the next one year in the district. The Kiosks were attached to the nearest branch and worked under the guidance of the concerned Branch Manager. The Branch Manager supervises and monitors the work of the Kiosks (BC). 1.7 At present, the Kiosks are mainly involved in providing banking services like, opening of savings bank accounts, recurring deposit accounts, acceptance of deposits and payment towards withdrawal. The kiosks are also dispensing old age pensions, student scholarships, MNREGA payments and other social sector payments, routed by the Government. The present monthly income (Rs. 8000 to Rs. 14,000) of the Kiosk is mainly from banking services. The expenditure involved was salary to the operator, rent of the premises, interest on the initial investment etc., which is about Rs. 8000 to Rs. 10,000 (Salary of the operator-Rs.4000 to Rs. 5000, Premises rent-about Rs. 2000 to Rs. 3000).","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Business Correspondent",,,200,input/md/english\FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,
