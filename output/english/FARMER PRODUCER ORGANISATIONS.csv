12,11,"A Producer Organisation (PO) is a legal entity formed by primary producers, viz. farmers, milk producers, fishermen, weavers, rural artisans, craftsmen. A PO can be a producer company, a cooperative society or any other legal form which provides for sharing of profits/benefits among the members. In some forms like producer companies, institutions of primary producers can also become member of PO. 1.2  What is the need for PO?  The main aim of PO is to ensure better income for the producers through an organization of their own.  Small producers do not have the volume individually (both inputs and produce) to get the benefit of economies of scale. Besides, in agricultural marketing, there is a long chain of intermediaries who very often work non-transparently leading to the situation where the producer receives only a small part of the value that the ultimate consumer pays. Through aggregation, the primary producers can avail the benefit of economies of scale. They will also have better bargaining power vis-à-vis the bulk buyers of produce and bulk suppliers of inputs. 1.3  What is a ""Farmers Producer Organisation"" (FPO)?  It is one type of PO where the members are farmers. Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) is providing support for promotion of FPOs. PO is a generic name for an organization of producers of any produce, e.g., agricultural, non-farm products, artisan products, etc. 1.4  Can there be a PO for non-farmers?  Yes. The PO is an organization of the primary producers. If the produce in question is a nonfarm item (for example, handloom or handicraft), then the PO will be that of non-farmers. The objective of the PO is to ensure better income realization to its members (who are producers) through aggregation and, if feasible, value addition. 1.5  What are the essential features of a PO?  a.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),Chapter 1 Concept Of Producer Organisation 1.1 What Is A Producer Organisation (Po)?",,,,,299,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

It deals with business activities related to the primary produce/product. e. It works for the benefit of the member producers. f. A part of the profit is shared amongst the producers. g. Rest of the surplus is added to its owned funds for business expansion.,"Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),Chapter 1 Concept Of Producer Organisation 1.1 What Is A Producer Organisation (Po)?",,,,,77,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

15,16,"The ownership of the PO is with its members. It is an organization of the producers, by the producers and for the producers. One or more institutions and/or individuals may have promoted the PO by way of assisting in mobilization, registration, business planning and operations. However, ownership control is always with members and management is through the representatives of the members.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.6 Who Owns The Po?",,,,,61,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

17,18,"Any individual or institution can promote a PO. Individual persons or institutions may promote PO using their own resources out of goodwill or with the noble objective of socioeconomic development of producers. If, however, the facilitating agency wishes to seek financial and other support, then they have to meet the requirements of the donor/financing agency. 1.8  Who provides support for promotion of PO?  NABARD, SFAC, Government Departments, Corporates and Domestic & International Aid Agencies provide financial and/or technical support to the Producer Organisation Promoting Institution (POPI) for promotion and hand-holding of the PO. Each agency has its own criteria for selecting the project/promoting institution to support. 1.9  Can an NGO promote PO?","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.7 Who Can Promote A Po?",,,,,112,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

21,22,"Institutions registered as cooperative societies and producer companies have legal provisions for sharing of profit earned by the PO by way of dividend. Other legal forms do not explicitly provide for profit sharing. However, the PO can offer better price for the produce it procures from the members, thus, benefiting the latter. Similarly, it can procure inputs/raw material in bulk and sell to members with low margin. Such activities are permissible for POs under all legal forms.

While choosing a legal form, the following factors may be kept in view:  a. Primary producers should benefit from the surplus generated by the PO. b. Process of Registration should not be too demanding in terms of time and  resources.  c. The legal form needs to fit into its business needs, organizational priorities, social  capital and management capacity.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.13 Is Registration Mandatory For A Po?",,,,,113,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

31,32,"The primary producers have skill and expertise in producing. However, they generally need support for marketing of what they produce. The PO will basically bridge this gap. The PO will take over the responsibility of any one or more activities in the value chain of the produce right from procurement of raw material to delivery of the final product at the ultimate consumers' doorstep. In brief, the PO could undertake the following activities:  a. Procurement of inputs b. Disseminating market information c. Dissemination of technology and innovations d. Facilitating finance for inputs e. Aggregation and storage of produce f. Primary processing like drying, cleaning and grading g. Brand building, Packaging, Labeling and Standardization h.

33,31,"A PO will support the members in getting more income by undertaking any/many/all of the activities listed under point 1.14 above. By aggregating the demand for inputs, the PO can buy in bulk, thus procuring at cheaper price compared to individual purchase. Besides, by transporting in bulk, cost of transportation is reduced. Thus reducing the overall cost of production. Similarly, the PO may aggregate the produce of all members and market in bulk, thus, fetching better price per unit of produce. The PO can also provide market information to the producers to enable them hold on to their produce till the market price become favourable. All these interventions will result in more income to the primary producers. 1.16  What are other benefits for the members of a PO (other than better income)?  A PO is a collective of farmers (and non-farmers) who are the primary producers of a product (an agricultural produce or a manufactured product). It, therefore, can work as a platform to facilitate better access to government services, like PDS, MNREGA, Scholarships and Pensions, etc. It can liaison with the Government Departments for convergence of programmes, like drinking water, sanitation, health and hygiene. 1.17  Who can become member of a PO?  PO is an organization of the producers, specifically the primary producers. All primary producers residing in the relevant geography, and producing the same or similar produce, for which the PO has been formed, can become member of the PO. Membership is voluntary. The procedure for obtaining PO membership depends on the bye-laws of the PO. The founder-members are those who were there at the time of formation of the PO. Other members join the PO later. However, all members enjoy equal rights.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.15 How Would A Po Help The Members?",,,,,285,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,
34,31,"A primary producer can become member of a PO by submitting an application and a nominal membership fee. Some POs also charge annual membership renewal fee. Although primary producers obtain membership of PO voluntarily, the promoting institution should make efforts to bring all producers into the PO, especially the small producers. 1.18  Who is a primary producer?   Any person engaged in any activity connected with or related to any primary produce will be treated as producer. Primary produce means the produce of farmers from agriculture and allied activities or produce of persons engaged in handloom, handicrafts and other cottage industries, including any by-product and product resulting from ancillary activities thereof. Primary produce also includes any activity intended to increase the production or quality of aforementioned products or activities. Persons engaged in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fishery, sericulture, apiary, handloom, handicrafts, etc., can become members of appropriate PO. Persons engaged in collection of minor forest produce are also eligible for membership of PO although they gather these from forests and strictly are not producers. 1.19  Can a person become member of more than one PO?   Family is the unit of production in rural areas. Benefits from the PO will accrue to members in proportion to the volume/value of produce given to the PO. Therefore, one person from a family can provide the whole produce of the family to the PO and get the same amount of benefit as multiple members providing the same volume/value. If however there are two different POs in the vicinity, each for a different type of produce, say vegetables and milk, one person can become member of both these POs, if the family produces both milk and vegetables.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.15 How Would A Po Help The Members?",,,,,281,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

36,33,"Each PO will have an elected Board of Management / Board of Directors as per the bye-laws. The Board can engage professionals to manage its affairs. In the initial years, professional and managerial assistance is usually extended by the POPI. As the leaders of the PO gain experience, they should take over the affairs of the PO completely. 1.21  Can a PO engage professionals to manage its business?  All legal forms provide for engaging professional and other employees by the PO. Such persons should be paid out of the income of the PO. As far as possible, the income should come from value addition to the produce and not from price paid to members. If members get price less than the market, they will gradually move away from the PO. The professionals and other employees should be paid at par with the prevailing market to ensure that they remain for long with the PO. Compensation will also depend upon the business plan, ensuring a positive surplus. 1.22  Can a PO procure produce from non-members?  The objective of the PO is to ensure better income to the member-producers through aggregation and value addition. Therefore, procurement from non-members is usually not undertaken. However, market exigencies at times may necessitate such procurement. There should be provision in the by-laws of a PO to enable procurement from non-members during such exigencies. 1.23  Can a PO sell the produce in the commodity exchanges?  Yes, it can. The PO can aggregate the produce of its members, and sell it using the commodity exchanges. The produce needs to meet the quality standards specified by the commodity exchanges, and be stored scientifically in approved warehouses. The PO can become a member of the Commodity Exchanges to do trading directly, or else it can sell through the exchange-approved brokers.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.20 Who Will Manage The Po?",,,,,300,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,
37,33,"1.24  Can a PO export the produce of its members?  Yes, it can. For exporting agricultural produce, all the members will have to follow Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). There are also other specific quality parameters that the importing countries impose for different produce which need to be complied with. For non-farm produce (handloom, handicrafts etc.), there are other quality specifications and other stipulations against using child labour, etc. 1.25  How much expenses will be incurred for registration of a PO?  Expenditure towards registration fee, stamp duty, preparation of documents and facilitation charges etc., will depend on the legal structure of the PO. In general, establishment of a producer company is more expensive than other legal forms.

45,46,"a. It is desirable to have a Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) for farmers having their  lands in contiguous micro-watersheds to address the issues relating to sustainability.  b. The productive land under an FPO may be around 4000 ha.  c. The PO may cover generally one or two contiguous Gram Panchayats for ease of  management.   d. The number of farmer producers that need to be covered may be around 700 to 1000. e. The cost of managing a Producer Organisation of the above nature may be around Rs.  2 lakh per month or Rs. 24 lakh per annum.  f. The total value of the produce of the farmers/non-farmers handled by the Producer  Organisation may be around Rs. 2.5 crore, assuming that approximately 10% of the total turnover of the PO may be reasonably spent towards cost of management.   g. Further, the markets selected for the Producer Organisation for selling their produce  may be within 200 KM to make their marketing activities viable.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.28 What Is The Optimal Size Of A Producer Organisation (Po) And What Are The Parameters?",,,,,161,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

47,43,"a. A Farmers Producer Organisation is to be designed in such a way to cover all the lands  that fall in one or two micro watersheds.  b. The sustainability of the farmers of the micro watersheds is already in existence with  various types of productive activities of the farmers to take care of risk factors, like variations in the market prices of various produce, continuity of income etc. which include sustainable agricultural practices.    c. The secret to sustainability of a PO depends on comprehensive engagement of the PO  with their members throughout the year.  d. The design variables for a PO are mainly size, scope, technology, ownership of  resources, management and purpose.  These variables need to be aligned to meet the sustainability requirements indicated in the earlier two points.    e. The size of the PO should be small to be able to be managed by the local talent  available in the area of the PO.  f. The scope of the PO should be defined in such a way that there shall be good number  of crops to be grown to maintain the soil health, support for allied activities like dairy, nutritional security of the local people and to mitigate risk.  g. The technology adopted by the PO should be such that majority of the local people or  members of the families of the PO should be able to adopt to it and work with it with minimal training, effectively.  h. The management of the PO should take into account the incubation of the local youth  in such a way that in a few years' time, say in 3-7 years, local youth should be able to take over and manage the PO effectively.  i.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.29 What Are The Design Variables / Factors Governing The Size Of Optimal Size Of A Po Ensuring That The Po Will Be Sustainable?",,,,,283,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,
48,43,"The purpose of the PO at all times must be to serve the larger needs of the community  and the ownership of the PO always should rest with all its members.  1.30 What should be the minimum and maximum number of members in a PO? The minimum number of membership depends on the legal form of the PO. For example, 10 or more primary producers can incorporate a Producer Company under Section 581(C) of Indian Companies Act 1956 (same provisions are retained in the 2013 Act). There is no restriction on the maximum number of membership. Generally, the PO will require certain minimum scale of operation to remain in business. This operation scale/volume is known as break-even level. Studies have shown that a PO will require about 700 to 1000 active producers as members for sustainable operation. 1.31 Who can become a Producer Organisation Promoting Institution (POPI)? An NGO, a bank branch, a Government Department, a Cooperative Society or any Association or Federation can become a POPI. Basically, the POPI needs to be a legal entity so that it can enter into legally valid contracts with other institutions including the PO which they seek to promote.

92,86,"PACS, being a registered cooperative society, has been providing credit and other services to its members. It has been observed that PACS are generally meeting the credit requirements of its members. However, there is a need to provide other services to the farmers and hence, PACS should be developed as a unit to meet all their needs. PACS are generally providing the following facilities to the members:  i.  Input facilities in form of cash or kind component to members  ii.  Agriculture implements on hiring basis  iii.  Storage facility  PACS can play an important role in providing these facilities to the farmers.  In order to enable PACS to provide more services to its members and generate income, an initiative was taken to develop PACS as multi service centres.  Some of the PACS are also assisting farmers in marketing of their produce. Thus, PACS can provide both backward and forward linkages to its members, thereby acting as a PO, in order to promote efficient crop production practices for its members on one hand and opportunities for better price realisation of their produce, on the other.  Following facilities can be taken up by PACS acting as a PO to the farmers:  a) **Agro-Storage centre:**  a. Upgradation of the existing storage facility or construction of new godown  along with sorting/ grading unit as per Negotiable Warehouse Receipt System. This will enable them to issue warehouse receipts. Based on these receipts, the farmers can get loan against the crop stored and can cultivate the next crop. Thus, the farmers will be facilitated to get better price by holding the crops without affecting the fund flow position.  b) **Agro-service Centre:**  a. Purchase of hi-tech agri-implements like power tiller, land leveller, rotary  slasher, movers, seed driller, multi crop planter, paddy transplanter, sprayers, combine harvester etc.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),2.12 Whether Pacs Can Act As Po?",,,,,298,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

171,172,"a. A Producer Company is a hybrid between a Private Limited Company and a  Cooperative Society, thus enjoying the benefits of professional management of a Private Limited Company as well as mutual benefits derived from a Cooperative Society.  b. Ownership and membership of a Producer Company is held only by ""primary  producers"" or ""Producer Institution/s"" and member's equity cannot be traded. Hence, nobody can take over the company or deprive the primary producers of their organisation.  c. The clauses of Private Limited Company shall be applicable to the producer companies  except the clauses specified in Producer Company Act from 581-A to 581-ZL which make it different from a normal private or limited company (refer the Producer Company Act for details). This enables a professional framework for a Producer Company.  d. The liability of the members is limited to the unpaid amount of the shares held by  them.  Hence, the private assets of the members are safe from company losses.  e. The minimum paid-up Capital being Rs. 1 Lakh and minimum authorized capital being  Rs.5 lakh for a PC, it easy to mobilise the small amount.   f. Minimum number of producers required to form a PC is 10 while there is no limit for  maximum number of members and the membership can be increased as per feasibility and need. This helps even 10 individuals start a Producer Company which is easy.  g. There cannot be any government or private equity stake in the Producer Companies,  which implies that PC cannot become a public or deemed public limited company. Hence, any Government or other corporate threat is non-existent in professional functioning of the company.  h. The area of operation for a PC is the entire country giving flexibility to expand and do  business in a free and professional manner.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),3.43 What Are The Advantages Of A Producer Company?",,,,,297,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

250,251,"7.1 What is the concept of value chain development?  Value chain comprises all the activities at different yet interlinked stages that add value to a particular product through the different phases of production, including procurement of raw materials and other inputs. Usually, there are many actors along the value chain for producing, transforming/processing and bringing goods and services to end-consumers through a series of sequential activities. When the produce originates from agriculture, we call it an agricultural value chain. Let us take the case of milk. For producing milk, the farmer requires milch cattle, feed and fodder and shed for the cattle. After milking (once/twice a day), the milk is taken to the collection centre where the volume, fat and SNF contents are measured. From the collection centre, milk is transported to the Bulk Milk Chilling Unit, where the milk is filtered and chilled to keep it fresh. From there, it goes to Milk Processing Plant, where bacteria is de-activated through pasteurization, and different types of milk and milk products are made. Liquid milk (whole milk, toned milk, vitamin-A fortified milk) is made into packets and sent to wholesalers. The retailers get milk packets from the wholesalers and sell to the consumers through milk booth and/or through door delivery. Processed milk products like butter, curd, cheese, ghee etc., also reach the end-consumers from the processing facility thorough the same channel. The whole chain from purchasing of milch cattle to delivery of milk packets to consumers is the value chain for milk. Though value is added at each stage, major addition takes place through Milk Chilling, Pasteurisation and Processing. All the persons/agencies undertaking one or more activities in this chain are called the actors in the value chain.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),Chapter 7 Business Planning",,,,,287,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

In the example above, the PO may manufacture/procure concentrate feed and supply it to the farmers. It can purchase milch cattle in bulk from outside the state for the members. It can establish Bulk Milk Chilling Unit or Milk Processing Plant. It can purchase refrigerated vans for transport of milk and milk products.  It can establish milk parlours to sell milk and milk products to the end-consumers. Any such activity will be a value chain intervention. The key is to choose the intervention where the value-addition (and therefore the margin) is high, and which can be effectively managed by the PO keeping in view competition in the market.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),",,,,,131,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

Sincere contemplation is needed about the business concept, the business opportunity, the competitive landscape, the essential elements for success, and the people who will be involved. The exercise will often lead to more questions, and these new questions must be properly researched to gain deep insight into the issues and challenges that lie ahead. In short, the business plan must contain answers to the questions  ""Who/What/Where/When/Why/How/How Much"". 7.5 What is business planning?

Competitors - Direct and indirect   7.14 How do you choose a marketing strategy? After choosing the market segment that the PO wishes to target and having carried out the SWOT analysis, the suitable marketing strategy should be chosen. The choice depends on a variety of factors including the image that the PO wants to project about the product and the organization, its sales objectives like whether it wants rapid penetration or is content with slow penetration of the market etc. The PO may choose one or more combinations of strategy, but needs to strategically plan a right mix of the 4 Ps (Product, Price, Place & Promotion - called the Marketing Mix) to develop an appropriate marketing strategy. 7.15 What is Operations Plan? Operations is the work (activity) of the business. It is transforming of the raw materials into products to be sold to the customer. The operations plan gives an overview of the flow of the daily activities of the business and the strategies that support them. The main purpose of the operations plan section is to show that the business is focused on the critical operating factors that will make it successful. It should contain the critical success factors affecting how the business creates value for the stakeholders of the business, and the breakeven point. 7.16 What is break-even point? It is that volume of operation of the business at which unit sales equals operating costs. The breakeven point determines how many units of the product must be sold to break even, to cover the cost of production. It is the point at which the business will have no profit, no loss.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),7.12 What Is Marketing Strategy?

The financial plan represents the best estimates of the risks involved, and the return on investment. Three financial areas are generally discussed in the financial plan:  a. Capital requirement and financing pattern b. Financial projections including cash flow statement c. Financial returns (Return on Investment, Internal Rate of Return, Net Present Value)   7.18 What is a 'Budget'? A budget is a forecast of all cash sources and deployments.

264,253,"a. The idea can be a solution to a problem experienced by primary producers. For  instance, collective sale of agricultural produce to the bigger market will reduce the role of middlemen and ensure better price to producers. Collective purchase of agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc., and selling them to the producers reduces per unit cost while ensuring quality of the inputs.  b. It can be for use of new technology or material to meet a widely felt need. An idea of  creating an agro service center for hiring tractor, power-tiller, transplanter, harvester, thresher etc., on rental basis to the small farmers can reduce cost of production besides increasing productivity. Similarly, establishing a Bulk Milk Chilling Unit for milk producers can be a good business idea.  c. It can be for establishing an Agri-Clinic for providing fee-based extension services.   7.20 How do you identify business opportunities and threats? Once a few business ideas are generated, each idea must be critically evaluated with respect to the external business environment for identifying the business opportunity and threats. Every idea must be evaluated to know whether it is worth pursuing. The opportunities and threats of each ideas are analysed in terms of the following attributes:  a. Size of the market  b. Its stability i.e., the demand for the product long term or purely temporary? c. The extent to which the market is dissatisfied with the existing solution d. Level of competition, high, medium or low e. Price and quality sensitivity of the market  f.  Barriers to entry/exit  g. Changes in government's policies such as subsidy, availability of low cost funds, etc.  7.21 How do you identify the risks and provide safeguards? Identification of risks and possible safeguards is an integral part of the Opportunity/Threat analysis.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),7.19 How Does One Generate Business Ideas?

265,253,"The goal is not to eliminate risk altogether (an impossible proposition) but to identify them and assess whether they can be managed or minimised through operational resilience. If the risks or threats seem unmanageable then one may discard the business idea all together. Even after starting the business, the risks continue to remain in the business environment, internally and externally both. Hence, it is important to develop risk assessment mechanism and risk mitigation strategy. There are five key steps in the development of this strategy.  a. The first step is to identify and map the processes/factors that would have the biggest  impact on earnings, if disrupted. For example, bad monsoon will severely affect crop production in rain-fed areas thus reducing earning of the PO considerably.  b. The second step is to identify critical infrastructure —including processes,  relationships, people, regulations, plant, and equipment—that supports the PO's ability to generate earnings. For example, if there is break-down in the Bulk Milk Chilling Unit, the whole stock of milk will be spoilt and go waste, besides adversely affecting the supply chain.   c. The third step is to identify the main vulnerabilities. Vulnerability is inability to cope  with the adverse effects of an event or risk. For example, storage, processing and trading of commodities can come under new regulation, imposing conditions, which the PO may find difficult to comply with, at short notice.   d. The fourth step is to identify the weakest links, the elements on which all the others  depend. For example, if there is a single buyer for all produces, this is the weakest link.   e. The last step is to develop planned response to mitigate the risks. For example, the  enterprise may build redundancies in some critical infrastructure like a spare refrigerated van for ferrying chilled milk.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),7.19 How Does One Generate Business Ideas?

For example, procurement of certified seeds through POs has been implemented by the Government of Chhattisgarh. The facilitating agency should be able to get the relevant information from the respective Governments. 7.23 What support is available from corporates for market linkage? The corporates need continuous supply of desired quality produce for processing and value addition. Therefore, they prefer to enter into contract with few producer organisations who will meet their requirement. Usually the following mechanisms are adopted:  a. Retail chains tie up with POs for procurement. b. Corporates extend dealership for farm machinery and inputs to POs. c. Corporates provide primary processing machinery to PO with buy-back arrangement  for the produce","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),7.19 How Does One Generate Business Ideas?

It includes steps designed to prevent problems before they occur and to correct deviations as soon as they are detected.  Such preventive control system with documentation and verification are  widely recognized by scientific authorities and international organizations as the most effective approach available for producing safe food.  b. HACCP involves a system approach to identification of hazard, assessment of chances of  occurrence of hazards during each phase, raw material procurement, manufacturing, distribution, usage of food products, and in defining the measures for hazard control.  In doing so, the many drawbacks prevalent in the inspection approach are prevented and HACCP overcomes shortcomings of reliance only on microbial testing.  c. HACCP enables the producers, processors, distributors, exporters, etc., of food products  to utilize technical resources efficiently and in a cost effective manner in assuring food safety.  Food inspection too would be more systematic and therefore hassle-free.

Life-cycle of technology- The life-cycle of computer systems is about three years while  that of grader/separator may be 10 years. For short life-cycle technology, it is desirable to go for the latest version.   b. Cost - The latest technology is invariably more expensive.  Therefore, it is desirable to  look for appropriate technology which is reasonably priced.  c. Competition - If other players in the market use the latest technology to produce  better products, the PO needs to go for better or the same technology to meet market competition.

A two track working capital limit, one at the base level taking care of the normal requirements over the year and another additional limit to take care of increased seasonal demands, is worked out. B. Projected Annual Turnover (PAT): The working capital credit limits provided by lending banks is at a minimum level of 20% of the Projected Annual Turnover (PAT). This norm is applicable in case of units (new as well as existing), village and tiny units with aggregate fund based 'working capital credit limits up to Rs.5 Crore from the banking system. The term PAT is with Gross Sales and not Net Sales.   a. The lending norms presuppose that the working capital requirements of a unit  may be considered as 25% of the value of output or PAT. Banks normally  provide 4/5th  or 80% of this amount, the residual portion to be brought in by  the promoter by way of margin from long term sources. The working capital credit limits provided by banks is at a minimum level of 20% of the projected annual turnover.   b.

The producers who sell their products to the PO, can sell on credit. PO can get part payment in advance from prospective buyers. It can get agriculture inputs from the Agro dealers on the conditions of payment after sales. But mostly this type of finance is not available for start-up businesses or a new venture.  c. **Equity**: In case of a PC the equity comes from the members and no external financier  can participate in the equity investment.   d. **Grant support:** The PC being a small holders' organization may seek capital support  and other assistance from the Government under certain government schemes. Two  major initiatives to support Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) (i) support to the equity base of FPOs by providing matching equity grants, and (ii) setting up of a Credit Guarantee Fund to provide cover to banks which advance loans to FPOs without collateral has been announced by GoI. The Schemes will be implemented by Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC). Details are given in Appendix ii. Funding may also be available from the Department of Rural Development and Panchayats, Ministries of Agriculture and Cooperation or Horticulture or Food Processing GoI and or state Governments under various schemes like National and State Horticulture Mission, Small Agribusiness Consortium.

Dealership from various companies for various agriculture implements like water  pump sets, mechanized plough, etc., which they can sell to their members at a reasonable price and earn commission.   d. Procurement of agriculture produce. The POs identified the prospective buyers and  arranged buy back guarantee from them. Sell was organized at the farm gate level, therefore no transportation and storage cost were involved at the PO level. PO ensured a transparent transaction between the buyers and sellers (members and nonmembers both) and by doing so they earned some margin from the buyers.   e. Many POs took the advantage of GoI scheme, which provide 80% of the value of  produce as loan against pledge of Warehouse Receipts (WHR) without collateral.    The successful demonstration of such business would build their credentials among the members and other stakeholders. Further, Demonstration of fair trade practices is very important for the PO.

381,382,"The impact of the project is directly related to the improvement of the individual producer's post period income when compared to the pre-project period.  The increase in income could be 'direct income' and 'indirect income'. Direct income is derived from increase in productivity and production. Indirect income is derived through timely availability of inputs and marketing arrangements at the door step of the farmer. This could be assessed in terms of person days and income could be assessed.   The indirect income could be added to direct income and the total income could be compared with the pre-project income. Total income from the project per producer per annum may be compared with the baseline income. Producer-wise data need to be collected in the house hold format. Analysis could be carried out  by collecting data by land holding size and compare the same and gap in the income levels could be assessed. Further, this data also may give leads to how the project helped small producers.",",9.18 What Is The Impact On Producer'S Income?",,,,,164,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

385,386,"The agriculture related impact could be on productivity, production, increase in cultivated area, increase in irrigated area and cropping intensity. For example, in FPO initiative, farmer/producer wise data on increased yield, production, cultivated area, irrigated area and cropping intensity may be seen. Further, investment in land levelling, creation of water resources, etc., will give how much additional area has been brought under the cultivation. This speaks about the quality of land which is developed due to the development of wasteland in the project area. Due to trainings and capacity building of the farmers/producers, there may be improvements in quality of the produce at the production, harvesting and storage level. The benefit from the improved quality on the price of the commodity could be assessed.   a. Further, is there any development in rural economy in the form of establishment of  micro enterprises, creation of more jobs etc., could be established from the number of new industries and number of people employed in these areas. Data related to trainings, like no of trainings, no of people trained, type of skill development trainings provided also could be assessed and the impact of trainings on the package of practices can be analyzed.",",9.20.

391,370,"Implementation of projects brings changes in the quality of life like improvement in the food security, changes in the consumption pattern, housing, health & hygiene, education of children etc,. Study and analysis of data related to these aspects is essential to assess the living standard of the people of the project area.   a. Food security: The 'food insecurity' is an important aspect. The assessment of scarcity  of food in pre and post project period gives an indication of the impact on the food security and quality of food intake.   b. Improved consumption basket: Under developmental projects, it is observed that  there is a relative reduction in the percentage of food expenditure and rise in the nonfood consumption items and other items showed improvement in the quality of life of producers in the post period scenario. There will be changes in the pattern of consumption like consumption of a variety of vegetables milk, milk products, poultry, meat, fruits etc., which will definitely indicate changes towards a better living.  c. Housing condition and sanitation facility: Housing is the first step in indicating better  quality of life and sanitation is also associated with it.  Assessment of immovable assets viz., house and sanitation facilities, during pre and post project gives an indication on the housing conditions and health improvements.  d. Adequate Safe Drinking Water: Safe drinking water is a key to healthy life of the family  and also a relief to women as fetching water from long distance is one of the curses for them.  Study of source of drinking water in each producer's house and the project impact on the development of infrastructure in the project area gives an idea of the changes brought by the project.   e.",",9.23 What Is The Impact On Quality Of Life Of The Producer?",,,,,285,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

420,398,"Monitoring can be defined as a systematic collection and analysis of information of an ongoing project. It is aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the project implementation so as to derive maximum benefits for the producers/PO. 10.2  What is efficiency?  Efficiency speaks about whether the output in terms of benefits exceed the expenditure. It is the ratio of output and input. Funding agency will monitor how efficient the POPI and PO has been in implementing the project. Similarly, the PO will monitor the same at the farmers 'producers' level. Certain parameters like the amount spent per farmer vis-a-vis the increase in income could be one indicator of efficiency. Higher the increase in income for the same amount spent, higher is the efficiency. 10.3  What is effectiveness?   Effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which the project achieved the specific objectives it set.   For example, if the objective of a project is to increase the income levels of all the farmers 'producers' engaged with the PO, we have to measure the extent of increase in income.  Similarly, if one of the objective is to increase the volume of the produce, we shall measure the extent of increase.   These assessments will indicate how effective the program has been. Higher the increase in income levels, higher would be the effectiveness of the project. 10.4  Who will monitor the Project?   The project is to be monitored by the PO, POPI and funding agency. 10.5 What is to be monitored by the PO? The PO has to satisfy itself that it is able to function in a sound manner for meeting the expectations of all the stakeholders. It also needs to monitor work execution at the producer level.",",9.32 Provide A Typical Organogram Of A Po?

421,398,"The PO has to prepare a work schedule/time line in consultation with the POPI for procurement of inputs, execution of works, marketing of produce. Accordingly, at each stage, review and monitoring has to be done by the PO. The PO has to evolve suitable formats for collecting data for the purpose of review and monitoring. 10.6 What is to be monitored by the POPI? The POPI has to monitor the work of the PO as well as ground level achievements. It has to assess the extent of progress of the work from time to time and if required suggest suitable measures. It has to arrange to design specific formats and provide to the PO. The PO will collect data in the specified formats and submit to the POPI and to funding agency.  Besides the progress, the POPI should also monitor staff availability for the project, data on individual producer, cost involved, availability of inputs, volume of produce, income, verification of the books of the PO etc., and submit detailed report to the funding agency on the agreed intervals, say monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly. 10.7  What is to be monitored by the Funding Agency: The funding agency has to evolve suitable formats for the submission of returns by PO/POPI. The funding agency has to monitor the targets vis-a-vis achievements, quality of implementation, participation of members and adequacy of training programmes. Monitoring enables the funding agency to determine whether the resources available are adequate and capacity of the human resources to implement the project is adequate.  Monitoring could be at desk level (office) or field level. 10.8  What is desk monitoring? Desk monitoring includes internal review of the project by the project funding agency.",",9.32 Provide A Typical Organogram Of A Po?

422,398,"It is difficult for the funding agency or the POPI to conduct field visits at frequent intervals, hence based on the returns submitted by the agency, desk review of the progress could be done. The findings could be discussed in a forum where POs and POPIs can participate. Based on the discussions, bottlenecks in the implementation could be identified, discussed and remedial measures initiated. The POPI will undertake review based on both the reports submitted by the PO and its own staff involved in the field. The review may involve the participation of PO at agreed intervals, so as to improve the implementation of the project. At every level, i.e., at the level of funding agency, POPI and PO, suitable formats for submission of data and suitable templates for presentations need to be evolved. The returns to be submitted by the PO should include:  a. Business projections/ assumptions submitted in proposal and comparison with  actual progress  b. Disbursements - Targets and achievements c. Repayments - Dues  and their repayment and overdue amount d. Operations of Designated Account; and Up-to-date correspondence with borrower e. Stock statements, annual report, latest balance sheet and P&L statements (If the  review is after annual closing)  f. Any pending compliance with terms and conditions  After obtaining the returns POPI and funding agency should:    a. Review progress b. Identify problems in planning and/or implementation c.

423,398,"There could be deviation in the implementation plan, violation of terms and conditions, shortfall in achievement, overdue amounts at the level of PO, operation of designated accounts, inadequacy of suitable  field staff, reduced participation of PO or POPI or the producers, which are to be closely monitored and if required, an immediate field level monitoring needs to be taken up.    10.10 What is Field Level Monitoring? Field level monitoring involves collection of actual data at the field level. It involves collection of 'elaborate' data from the field level by interacting with the farmers/producers and other stake holders. Specific proforma on the pattern of the format suggested in Chapter 9 could be evolved for collection of data or depending upon the requirement suitable proforma need to be designed for collection of data. Often, field level monitoring data on the following aspects is also important as these factors provide leads to the success or failure of the project:  a. Availability of inputs to members - timeliness b. Technical support available to members - targeted Vs. actual frequency c. Storage and processing arrangement - planned Vs. achievement  d. Marketing tie-up - planned benefits Vs. actual benefits e. Targeted Productivity / Income growth Vs. Actual achievements f. Members views regarding the services provided by PO and its efficacy   10.11 How to Plan Monitoring of Projects? Monitoring should be a part of planning process.  It is desirable to frame monitoring parameters in the beginning of planning process itself. These parameters should be in line with the objectives of the project. Therefore, the funding agency, POPI and the PO have to begin gathering information about performance in relation to targets from the beginning itself.  In fact, the first information gathering should take place when the project is planned. 10.12  What indicators can we suggest?",",9.32 Provide A Typical Organogram Of A Po?

How many? - Number of people benefitted. How much? - What is the extent of benefit? Some examples of Indicators could be as follows: Please note that these are illustrative and are related to agriculture projects - they may or may not suit the needs of other Non-farm based projects.

Indicators are developed based on the objectives / impact assessment of the project. For example, in an agriculture based project, the following might be the objectives:  a. To improve the producer's income b. To develop the area under agriculture c. To arrest migration d. To improve marketing facilities e. To bring change in the quality of lives of the people f. To create awareness on sustainability of natural resources g. To improve the participation of women in the developmental process to address  gender issues  h. To bring awareness on  savings, investment and credit availability i. To bring awareness on social situation (housing, health, education etc.)  j.

570,571,"1.1 Chhattisgarh is among the few states in India that have recorded impressive growth in agriculture in recent years. Development of farmers own institutions catering to their various needs, has kept pace with the agricultural growth. As on 30 September 2014, the state had 3,679 farmers clubs (FCs). There were eight federations of farmer clubs in the state, five in Mahasamund, two in Bilaspur and one in Mungeli district. In Bilaspur and Mungeli districts (the study area), 300 FCs were formed, of which 201 were active. Majority of the farmer clubs (129 clubs) were formed by the Regional Rural Bank (Gramin Bank). Other promoting institutions include Chhattisgarh Agricon Samiti (30), CARMDAKSH (12), SBI (12), ARDB (8) and IFFDC (5). While all the clubs were active in the initial three years, many slipped into dormancy through inaction and non-availability of hand-holding support. These clubs did not have any vision or roadmap for the future. 1.2 The Chhattisgarh RO and DDM Bilaspur were keen to make the farmer clubs a sustainable entity and felt the need to federate the clubs to a higher tier so as to make the entire farmer clubs programme sustainable and the organization a viable model. With this in view, the farmer clubs were federated into four farmer club federations and were registered under 'Chhattisgarh Society Registrikaran Adhiniyam, 1973' in the year 2012.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Introduction",,,,,225,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

572,573,"1.3 To promote financial literacy among the farmers and school children, NABARD Chhattisgarh RO engaged the Farmers Club Federations and provided financial assistance. Initially 10 awareness programmes and 20 quiz programmes were sanctioned for Bilaspur and Mungeli districts and organized by the Farmer Club Federations (FCF). As the federations and farmer clubs are village level bodies and have local presence and acceptance, they could mobilize children and their parents in good numbers. Looking at the encouraging results, the RO sanctioned more awareness and quiz programmes at different times thereafter. This provided much needed scope for interaction between the DDM, Farmer Federations, bank officials and the Government officials which paved way for making the federations financially sustainable entities.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Financial Literacy Through Farmers Clubs",,,,,117,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

574,575,"1.4 With active support of the District Agriculture Department, the federations were involved in establishing field demonstration plots for cultivation of paddy (300 ha), chana (500 ha) and green gram (500 ha). Similarly, the agriculture department also encouraged the federations to establish retail outlets for selling inputs like seeds, pesticides and fertilizers by providing them with retail licenses.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Agricultural Extension",,,,,58,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

578,579,"1.6 Due to greater acceptability of the federations in the villages, State Bank of India (SBI) approved opening of Kiosks under BC model through federations to achieve financial inclusion. As on September 2014, 16 kiosks were working through three farmer club federations. SBI was in the process of establishing 14 more Kiosks at other village centres in the next one year in the district. The Kiosks were attached to the nearest branch and worked under the guidance of the concerned Branch Manager. The Branch Manager supervises and monitors the work of the Kiosks (BC). 1.7 At present, the Kiosks are mainly involved in providing banking services like, opening of savings bank accounts, recurring deposit accounts, acceptance of deposits and payment towards withdrawal. The kiosks are also dispensing old age pensions, student scholarships, MNREGA payments and other social sector payments, routed by the Government. The present monthly income (Rs. 8000 to Rs. 14,000) of the Kiosk is mainly from banking services. The expenditure involved was salary to the operator, rent of the premises, interest on the initial investment etc., which is about Rs. 8000 to Rs. 10,000 (Salary of the operator-Rs.4000 to Rs. 5000, Premises rent-about Rs. 2000 to Rs. 3000).","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Business Correspondent",,,,,200,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

580,515,"1.8 Many of the leaders of the Farmer Club Federations (FCFs) got registered individually with Agriculture Department as seed farmers. The FCFs realized that there may be some business sense in establishing their own seed processing facility. This would be a step forward in the seed value chain, besides serving the needs of its famer members. 1.9 This breakthrough came in the form of 'Kisaan Beej' a 'Producer Organization' formed by a group of farmers from Arpanchal Farmers Club Federation. The PO was registered under 'Chhattisgarh Autonomous Cooperative Act, 1999', which allows the farmer groups to work as a business entity and earn profits. The PO is anchoring the programme of producing and marketing of certified seeds of paddy (five varieties), wheat, soybean, mustard, gram, arhar, mung and horse garm (tiwda). 1.10 During 2013-14, 39 members of the PO were registered with the Seed Certifying Authority of the State Govt. to produce certified seed (25 farmers in 153 ha. during Khariff and 14 farmers in 106 ha. during Rabi). The total production of certified seed by these members during the year was 656 MT in Khariff and 394 MT in Rabi. Total seed produced by these farmers were procured by the PO at a cost of Rs. 73.32 lakh. Subsidy is provided to seed farmers to encourage them to sell the seed to seed procurement institutions (and not in the mandis). Similarly, to encourage farmers to use certified seeds, the Government provides subsidy to seed processing institutions so that quality seed can be made available to farmers at a reasonable rate. For the year 2014-15, the PO has a programme to procure certified seed of about 2700 MT from its members. It has so far contracted seed-growing farmers for 380 ha. paddy for Khariff and 195 ha. paddy for Rabi.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Kisan Beej Producer Organisation",,,,,300,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,
581,515,"1.11 The PO has established infrastructure facilities for cleaning, grading, packaging, certification and storage of certified seed. The seed is sold through the outlets of farmer federations, set up adjoining the BC Kiosks. The PO has found a niche market for its services among the farmers. The PO could capture the seed market to the extent of 30%. Still there exists large scope for expansion for the PO in the district.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Kisan Beej Producer Organisation",,,,,71,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

583,584,"1.12 As the farmers need an assurance from the PO for procurement of seeds and similarly the PO also has to have assured supply of seeds, PO provides advance to the farmers for inputs and consumption. NABARD provided financial assistance of Rs.1.943 crore (Rs. 1.85 crore as loan & Rs.9.43 lakh as grant) on 23 Sep 2013 to support the PO for on-lending to farmers. The loan assistance was for procurement of seeds, creation of infrastructure for cleaning, grading, packaging and storage, holding costs till seed is sold. The grant support was extended for capacity building and training, etc. As at the end of May 2014, loan amount of Rs. 1.74 crore was disbursed. Discussions with the office bearers of PO revealed that they plan to seek higher sanctions from NABARD for the enhanced business programme during 2014-15.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Kisan Beej Producer Organisation",,,,,138,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

586,587,"1.13   The Certification Agency, Dept. of Agriculture, Government of Chhattisgarh (GoCG), registers the farmers cultivating seeds. The farmers have to submit application to the department with land documents and register themselves by paying fee of Rs. 300 per ha. The farmers clubs, federation and PO help the farmers in registration. The Department provides foundation seed to the farmers and also conducts field monitoring of the plots from time to time to ensure scrupulous adherence to package of practices for producing seed. Representatives of the certifying agency visit the field at least three times during a crop cycle; at the time of planting, at the flowering stage and at the time of harvest. This ensures that good quality seeds are produced.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Registration For Seed Production",,,,,120,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

588,589,"1.14 After approval and certification, the PO packages the seed in 30 kg. bags, duly sealed. The seed is being marketed under the brand name ""Kisan Beej"". The PO has the option to sell the certified seed directly to the farmers, Agriculture Department, PACS or Seed Corporation. In case the seed is not approved, it is sent to PACS for Government procurement, where the PO gets the amount as per the MSP. If the seed is approved, farmers get Rs. 2,090 per quintal (consisting of Rs. 1,310 MSP plus Rs. 450 production charges and Rs. 330 as bonus) for seed cultivation. Seed production subsidy and bonus to the farmers is routed through the PO. Similarly, for handling seed, the PO gets Government subsidy of Rs. 740 per quintal of seed (Rs. 50 for production, Rs. 500 for processing and distribution and Rs. 190 for storage). The expenditure involved by the PO was Rs.100 for transportation, Rs.450 for cleaning, grading, packaging and storage and interest on loan Rs.90, thus, the total was Rs. 650 per quintal. The net profit per quintal was Rs. 90 for the PO which is available for administration and other overheads. 1.15 The PO was using the Kiosks opened by the farmer federations as outlet points for selling seed. A commission of 4% was given by the PO to the federations on the sales. Transportation charges are presently borne by the PO. For the farmer federations which are operating Kiosks, it was an additional source of income, making kiosks financial viable. The PO is providing certified seeds to the farmers of farmer clubs at their door step and extending the much needed banking services to them.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Seed Certification",,,,,279,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,

590,591,"1.16 The model of the PO with federations and farmer clubs at the ground level with Kiosks/outlets for inputs and services can be considered as sustainable for the following reasons:  a.  It is a farmer organization from top to bottom, providing essential services to the farming community. Hence, the acceptance level in the farming community is high.   b.  With renewed focus on financial inclusion, farmer clubs can act as BCs of banks, facilitated through their federations. This will ensure that farmers get both banking services and agricultural inputs and related information at one place.   c.  Production, processing and consumption of certified seed is carried out to meet the requirement of the farmers, creating readymade market locally.  The benefits to the farmers include timely availability of high quality seed at a reasonable cost.   d.  The State Government is channelizing its payments/subsidies under 7-8 schemes through these kiosks making them more popular among the farmers.   e.  The operating margin at the PO level is quite satisfactory. In its first year, it has surpassed the break-even level, even earning a little surplus. The State Government supported the farmers for cultivating seed and the PO for processing the seed. The demand for quality seed is more than what the farmers could produce at present.  Therefore, there is scope for growth. There is potential for the activity to become viable, even without subsidy.  f.  For the State Government, there is a farmer organization which is able to take care of the input needs of the farmers. State Government can converge some of its agricultural schemes through the PO/ farmer federation and reach the unreached. Agricultural extension services can be provided using this institutional arrangement at a lower cost to a large number of farmers.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Replication Of The Model",,,,,289,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,
