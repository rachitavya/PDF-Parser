5,4,"A Producer Organisation (PO) is a legal entity formed by primary producers, viz. farmers, milk producers, fishermen, weavers, rural artisans, craftsmen. A PO can be a producer company, a cooperative society or any other legal form which provides for sharing of profits/benefits among the members. In some forms like producer companies, institutions of primary producers can also become member of PO. 1.2  What is the need for PO?  The main aim of PO is to ensure better income for the producers through an organization of their own.  Small producers do not have the volume individually (both inputs and produce) to get the benefit of economies of scale. Besides, in agricultural marketing, there is a long chain of intermediaries who very often work non-transparently leading to the situation where the producer receives only a small part of the value that the ultimate consumer pays. Through aggregation, the primary producers can avail the benefit of economies of scale. They will also have better bargaining power vis-Ã -vis the bulk buyers of produce and bulk suppliers of inputs. 1.3  What is a ""Farmers Producer Organisation"" (FPO)?  It is one type of PO where the members are farmers.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),Chapter 1 Concept Of Producer Organisation 1.1 What Is A Producer Organisation (Po)?",,,,,193,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"A Producer Organisation (PO) is a legal entity formed by primary producers, such as farmers, milk producers, fishermen, weavers, rural artisans, and craftsmen, to share profits and benefits.

6,4,"Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) is providing support for promotion of FPOs. PO is a generic name for an organization of producers of any produce, e.g., agricultural, non-farm products, artisan products, etc. 1.4  Can there be a PO for non-farmers?  Yes. The PO is an organization of the primary producers. If the produce in question is a nonfarm item (for example, handloom or handicraft), then the PO will be that of non-farmers. The objective of the PO is to ensure better income realization to its members (who are producers) through aggregation and, if feasible, value addition. 1.5  What are the essential features of a PO?  a. It is formed by a group of producers for either farm or non-farm activities. b. It is a registered body and a legal entity. c. Producers are shareholders in the organization. d. It deals with business activities related to the primary produce/product. e. It works for the benefit of the member producers. f. A part of the profit is shared amongst the producers. g.

7,9,"The ownership of the PO is with its members. It is an organization of the producers, by the producers and for the producers.

Individual persons or institutions may promote PO using their own resources out of goodwill or with the noble objective of socioeconomic development of producers. If, however, the facilitating agency wishes to seek financial and other support, then they have to meet the requirements of the donor/financing agency. 1.8  Who provides support for promotion of PO?  NABARD, SFAC, Government Departments, Corporates and Domestic & International Aid Agencies provide financial and/or technical support to the Producer Organisation Promoting Institution (POPI) for promotion and hand-holding of the PO.

16,18,"The primary producers have skill and expertise in producing. However, they generally need support for marketing of what they produce. The PO will basically bridge this gap. The PO will take over the responsibility of any one or more activities in the value chain of the produce right from procurement of raw material to delivery of the final product at the ultimate consumers' doorstep. In brief, the PO could undertake the following activities:  a. Procurement of inputs b. Disseminating market information c. Dissemination of technology and innovations d. Facilitating finance for inputs e. Aggregation and storage of produce f. Primary processing like drying, cleaning and grading g. Brand building, Packaging, Labeling and Standardization h.

17,15,"A PO will support the members in getting more income by undertaking any/many/all of the activities listed under point 1.14 above. By aggregating the demand for inputs, the PO can buy in bulk, thus procuring at cheaper price compared to individual purchase. Besides, by transporting in bulk, cost of transportation is reduced. Thus reducing the overall cost of production. Similarly, the PO may aggregate the produce of all members and market in bulk, thus, fetching better price per unit of produce. The PO can also provide market information to the producers to enable them hold on to their produce till the market price become favourable. All these interventions will result in more income to the primary producers. 1.16  What are other benefits for the members of a PO (other than better income)?  A PO is a collective of farmers (and non-farmers) who are the primary producers of a product (an agricultural produce or a manufactured product). It, therefore, can work as a platform to facilitate better access to government services, like PDS, MNREGA, Scholarships and Pensions, etc. It can liaison with the Government Departments for convergence of programmes, like drinking water, sanitation, health and hygiene.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.15 How Would A Po Help The Members?",,,,,195,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"A Farmer Producer Organisation (PO) can help its members by increasing their income through activities like bulk purchasing of inputs at cheaper prices, reducing transportation costs, and aggregating and marketing produce for better prices.

It can also work as a platform to liaise with government departments for convergence of various programs related to drinking water, sanitation, health, and hygiene."
18,15,"1.17  Who can become member of a PO?  PO is an organization of the producers, specifically the primary producers. All primary producers residing in the relevant geography, and producing the same or similar produce, for which the PO has been formed, can become member of the PO. Membership is voluntary. The procedure for obtaining PO membership depends on the bye-laws of the PO. The founder-members are those who were there at the time of formation of the PO. Other members join the PO later. However, all members enjoy equal rights. A primary producer can become member of a PO by submitting an application and a nominal membership fee. Some POs also charge annual membership renewal fee. Although primary producers obtain membership of PO voluntarily, the promoting institution should make efforts to bring all producers into the PO, especially the small producers. 1.18  Who is a primary producer?   Any person engaged in any activity connected with or related to any primary produce will be treated as producer. Primary produce means the produce of farmers from agriculture and allied activities or produce of persons engaged in handloom, handicrafts and other cottage industries, including any by-product and product resulting from ancillary activities thereof.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.15 How Would A Po Help The Members?",,,,,200,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"A Farmer Producer Organisation (PO) is an organization of primary producers, and all primary producers in the relevant area producing the same or similar produce can become members voluntarily.

A primary producer can join by submitting an application and nominal membership fee, with some POs charging an annual renewal fee. A primary producer is anyone engaged in activities related to primary produce, including farming, handloom, handicrafts, and cottage industries."
19,15,"Primary produce also includes any activity intended to increase the production or quality of aforementioned products or activities. Persons engaged in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fishery, sericulture, apiary, handloom, handicrafts, etc., can become members of appropriate PO. Persons engaged in collection of minor forest produce are also eligible for membership of PO although they gather these from forests and strictly are not producers. 1.19  Can a person become member of more than one PO?   Family is the unit of production in rural areas. Benefits from the PO will accrue to members in proportion to the volume/value of produce given to the PO. Therefore, one person from a family can provide the whole produce of the family to the PO and get the same amount of benefit as multiple members providing the same volume/value. If however there are two different POs in the vicinity, each for a different type of produce, say vegetables and milk, one person can become member of both these POs, if the family produces both milk and vegetables.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.15 How Would A Po Help The Members?",,,,,171,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"Agricultural, horticultural, and other related workers can join a Producer Organisation (PO) to improve the production and quality of their products. Even those involved in gathering minor forest produce are eligible for membership, despite not being direct producers. In rural areas, the family is considered the production unit, and benefits from the PO are distributed based on the volume or value of the produce contributed. This means that one person can provide the entire family's produce to the PO and receive benefits equivalent to multiple members. If different POs cater to distinct types of produce, such as vegetables and milk, a person can join multiple POs if their family produces both types of goods."
20,16,"Each PO will have an elected Board of Management / Board of Directors as per the bye-laws. The Board can engage professionals to manage its affairs. In the initial years, professional and managerial assistance is usually extended by the POPI. As the leaders of the PO gain experience, they should take over the affairs of the PO completely. 1.21  Can a PO engage professionals to manage its business?  All legal forms provide for engaging professional and other employees by the PO. Such persons should be paid out of the income of the PO. As far as possible, the income should come from value addition to the produce and not from price paid to members. If members get price less than the market, they will gradually move away from the PO. The professionals and other employees should be paid at par with the prevailing market to ensure that they remain for long with the PO. Compensation will also depend upon the business plan, ensuring a positive surplus. 1.22  Can a PO procure produce from non-members?  The objective of the PO is to ensure better income to the member-producers through aggregation and value addition. Therefore, procurement from non-members is usually not undertaken.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),1.20 Who Will Manage The Po?",,,,,200,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The PO will have an elected Board of Management to manage its affairs, with the option to engage professionals for assistance.

Procurement from non-members is generally not undertaken, as the PO's objective is to improve the income of member-producers through aggregation and value addition."
21,16,"However, market exigencies at times may necessitate such procurement. There should be provision in the by-laws of a PO to enable procurement from non-members during such exigencies. 1.23  Can a PO sell the produce in the commodity exchanges?  Yes, it can. The PO can aggregate the produce of its members, and sell it using the commodity exchanges. The produce needs to meet the quality standards specified by the commodity exchanges, and be stored scientifically in approved warehouses. The PO can become a member of the Commodity Exchanges to do trading directly, or else it can sell through the exchange-approved brokers. 1.24  Can a PO export the produce of its members?  Yes, it can. For exporting agricultural produce, all the members will have to follow Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). There are also other specific quality parameters that the importing countries impose for different produce which need to be complied with.

Value chain comprises all the activities at different yet interlinked stages that add value to a particular product through the different phases of production, including procurement of raw materials and other inputs. Usually, there are many actors along the value chain for producing, transforming/processing and bringing goods and services to end-consumers through a series of sequential activities. When the produce originates from agriculture, we call it an agricultural value chain. Let us take the case of milk. For producing milk, the farmer requires milch cattle, feed and fodder and shed for the cattle. After milking (once/twice a day), the milk is taken to the collection centre where the volume, fat and SNF contents are measured. From the collection centre, milk is transported to the Bulk Milk Chilling Unit, where the milk is filtered and chilled to keep it fresh. From there, it goes to Milk Processing Plant, where bacteria is de-activated through pasteurization, and different types of milk and milk products are made. Liquid milk (whole milk, toned milk, vitamin-A fortified milk) is made into packets and sent to wholesalers.","Farmer Producer Organisations Frequently Asked Questions (Faqs),Chapter 7 Business Planning",,,,,189,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"Value chain development involves all the interconnected activities that add value to a product through various production stages, including sourcing raw materials and other inputs.

Efficiency speaks about whether the output in terms of benefits exceed the expenditure. It is the ratio of output and input. Funding agency will monitor how efficient the POPI and PO has been in implementing the project. Similarly, the PO will monitor the same at the farmers 'producers' level. Certain parameters like the amount spent per farmer vis-a-vis the increase in income could be one indicator of efficiency. Higher the increase in income for the same amount spent, higher is the efficiency. 10.3  What is effectiveness?   Effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which the project achieved the specific objectives it set.   For example, if the objective of a project is to increase the income levels of all the farmers 'producers' engaged with the PO, we have to measure the extent of increase in income.  Similarly, if one of the objective is to increase the volume of the produce, we shall measure the extent of increase.",",9.32 Provide A Typical Organogram Of A Po?

The PO has to satisfy itself that it is able to function in a sound manner for meeting the expectations of all the stakeholders. It also needs to monitor work execution at the producer level. The PO has to prepare a work schedule/time line in consultation with the POPI for procurement of inputs, execution of works, marketing of produce. Accordingly, at each stage, review and monitoring has to be done by the PO. The PO has to evolve suitable formats for collecting data for the purpose of review and monitoring. 10.6 What is to be monitored by the POPI?

349,256,"1.1 Chhattisgarh is among the few states in India that have recorded impressive growth in agriculture in recent years. Development of farmers own institutions catering to their various needs, has kept pace with the agricultural growth. As on 30 September 2014, the state had 3,679 farmers clubs (FCs). There were eight federations of farmer clubs in the state, five in Mahasamund, two in Bilaspur and one in Mungeli district. In Bilaspur and Mungeli districts (the study area), 300 FCs were formed, of which 201 were active. Majority of the farmer clubs (129 clubs) were formed by the Regional Rural Bank (Gramin Bank). Other promoting institutions include Chhattisgarh Agricon Samiti (30), CARMDAKSH (12), SBI (12), ARDB (8) and IFFDC (5). While all the clubs were active in the initial three years, many slipped into dormancy through inaction and non-availability of hand-holding support. These clubs did not have any vision or roadmap for the future. 1.2 The Chhattisgarh RO and DDM Bilaspur were keen to make the farmer clubs a sustainable entity and felt the need to federate the clubs to a higher tier so as to make the entire farmer clubs programme sustainable and the organization a viable model.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Introduction",,,,,198,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"Chhattisgarh has seen significant agricultural growth and the development of farmers' institutions, with 3,679 farmers clubs in the state as of September 2014.

Initially 10 awareness programmes and 20 quiz programmes were sanctioned for Bilaspur and Mungeli districts and organized by the Farmer Club Federations (FCF). As the federations and farmer clubs are village level bodies and have local presence and acceptance, they could mobilize children and their parents in good numbers. Looking at the encouraging results, the RO sanctioned more awareness and quiz programmes at different times thereafter. This provided much needed scope for interaction between the DDM, Farmer Federations, bank officials and the Government officials which paved way for making the federations financially sustainable entities.","Financial Literacy Through Farmers Clubs, Chhattisgarh State,Introduction,Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District",,,,,144,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The farmer clubs were federated into four farmer club federations and registered under 'Chhattisgarh Society Registrikaran Adhiniyam, 1973' in 2012.

As on September 2014, 16 kiosks were working through three farmer club federations. SBI was in the process of establishing 14 more Kiosks at other village centres in the next one year in the district. The Kiosks were attached to the nearest branch and worked under the guidance of the concerned Branch Manager. The Branch Manager supervises and monitors the work of the Kiosks (BC). 1.7 At present, the Kiosks are mainly involved in providing banking services like, opening of savings bank accounts, recurring deposit accounts, acceptance of deposits and payment towards withdrawal. The kiosks are also dispensing old age pensions, student scholarships, MNREGA payments and other social sector payments, routed by the Government. The present monthly income (Rs. 8000 to Rs. 14,000) of the Kiosk is mainly from banking services. The expenditure involved was salary to the operator, rent of the premises, interest on the initial investment etc., which is about Rs. 8000 to Rs. 10,000 (Salary of the operator-Rs.4000 to Rs. 5000, Premises rent-about Rs. 2000 to Rs. 3000).","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Business Correspondent",,,,,200,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The State Bank of India approved the opening of Kiosks under BC model through federations to achieve financial inclusion in Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State.

353,261,"1.8 Many of the leaders of the Farmer Club Federations (FCFs) got registered individually with Agriculture Department as seed farmers. The FCFs realized that there may be some business sense in establishing their own seed processing facility. This would be a step forward in the seed value chain, besides serving the needs of its famer members. 1.9 This breakthrough came in the form of 'Kisaan Beej' a 'Producer Organization' formed by a group of farmers from Arpanchal Farmers Club Federation. The PO was registered under 'Chhattisgarh Autonomous Cooperative Act, 1999', which allows the farmer groups to work as a business entity and earn profits. The PO is anchoring the programme of producing and marketing of certified seeds of paddy (five varieties), wheat, soybean, mustard, gram, arhar, mung and horse garm (tiwda). 1.10 During 2013-14, 39 members of the PO were registered with the Seed Certifying Authority of the State Govt. to produce certified seed (25 farmers in 153 ha. during Khariff and 14 farmers in 106 ha. during Rabi). The total production of certified seed by these members during the year was 656 MT in Khariff and 394 MT in Rabi.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Kisan Beej Producer Organisation",,,,,191,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The Farmer Club Federations leaders registered as seed farmers and saw the potential in establishing their own seed processing facility to advance the seed value chain and meet the needs of their members.

354,261,"Total seed produced by these farmers were procured by the PO at a cost of Rs. 73.32 lakh. Subsidy is provided to seed farmers to encourage them to sell the seed to seed procurement institutions (and not in the mandis). Similarly, to encourage farmers to use certified seeds, the Government provides subsidy to seed processing institutions so that quality seed can be made available to farmers at a reasonable rate. For the year 2014-15, the PO has a programme to procure certified seed of about 2700 MT from its members. It has so far contracted seed-growing farmers for 380 ha. paddy for Khariff and 195 ha. paddy for Rabi. 1.11 The PO has established infrastructure facilities for cleaning, grading, packaging, certification and storage of certified seed. The seed is sold through the outlets of farmer federations, set up adjoining the BC Kiosks. The PO has found a niche market for its services among the farmers. The PO could capture the seed market to the extent of 30%. Still there exists large scope for expansion for the PO in the district.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Kisan Beej Producer Organisation",,,,,180,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The Kisan Beej Producer Organisation in Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State has successfully procured a total seed production from farmers at a cost of Rs. 73.32 lakh.

356,395,"1.12 As the farmers need an assurance from the PO for procurement of seeds and similarly the PO also has to have assured supply of seeds, PO provides advance to the farmers for inputs and consumption. NABARD provided financial assistance of Rs.1.943 crore (Rs. 1.85 crore as loan & Rs.9.43 lakh as grant) on 23 Sep 2013 to support the PO for on-lending to farmers. The loan assistance was for procurement of seeds, creation of infrastructure for cleaning, grading, packaging and storage, holding costs till seed is sold. The grant support was extended for capacity building and training, etc. As at the end of May 2014, loan amount of Rs. 1.74 crore was disbursed. Discussions with the office bearers of PO revealed that they plan to seek higher sanctions from NABARD for the enhanced business programme during 2014-15.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Kisan Beej Producer Organisation",,,,,138,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The Producer Organization (PO) provides advance to farmers for inputs and consumption, while also assuring procurement of seeds.

357,396,"1.13   The Certification Agency, Dept. of Agriculture, Government of Chhattisgarh (GoCG), registers the farmers cultivating seeds. The farmers have to submit application to the department with land documents and register themselves by paying fee of Rs. 300 per ha. The farmers clubs, federation and PO help the farmers in registration. The Department provides foundation seed to the farmers and also conducts field monitoring of the plots from time to time to ensure scrupulous adherence to package of practices for producing seed. Representatives of the certifying agency visit the field at least three times during a crop cycle; at the time of planting, at the flowering stage and at the time of harvest. This ensures that good quality seeds are produced.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Registration For Seed Production",,,,,120,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"Farmers in Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State register for seed production through the Certification Agency, Dept. of Agriculture, Government of Chhattisgarh by submitting applications and paying a fee.

358,265,"1.14 After approval and certification, the PO packages the seed in 30 kg. bags, duly sealed. The seed is being marketed under the brand name ""Kisan Beej"". The PO has the option to sell the certified seed directly to the farmers, Agriculture Department, PACS or Seed Corporation. In case the seed is not approved, it is sent to PACS for Government procurement, where the PO gets the amount as per the MSP. If the seed is approved, farmers get Rs. 2,090 per quintal (consisting of Rs. 1,310 MSP plus Rs. 450 production charges and Rs. 330 as bonus) for seed cultivation. Seed production subsidy and bonus to the farmers is routed through the PO. Similarly, for handling seed, the PO gets Government subsidy of Rs. 740 per quintal of seed (Rs. 50 for production, Rs. 500 for processing and distribution and Rs. 190 for storage). The expenditure involved by the PO was Rs.100 for transportation, Rs.450 for cleaning, grading, packaging and storage and interest on loan Rs.90, thus, the total was Rs. 650 per quintal. The net profit per quintal was Rs. 90 for the PO which is available for administration and other overheads.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Seed Certification",,,,,194,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The producer organization (PO) in Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State, packages certified seeds under the brand name ""Kisan Beej"" and has various options for selling the seeds.

The PO also receives subsidies for seed handling and incurs various expenses, resulting in a net profit of Rs. 90 per quintal."
359,265,"1.15 The PO was using the Kiosks opened by the farmer federations as outlet points for selling seed. A commission of 4% was given by the PO to the federations on the sales. Transportation charges are presently borne by the PO. For the farmer federations which are operating Kiosks, it was an additional source of income, making kiosks financial viable. The PO is providing certified seeds to the farmers of farmer clubs at their door step and extending the much needed banking services to them.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Seed Certification",,,,,85,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The Producer Organization (PO) utilized farmer federations' kiosks to sell seeds, offering a 4% commission on sales and covering transportation costs. This arrangement provided additional income for the farmer federations and ensured the financial viability of the kiosks. Furthermore, the PO supplied certified seeds to farmer clubs and offered essential banking services directly to the farmers."
360,266,"1.16 The model of the PO with federations and farmer clubs at the ground level with Kiosks/outlets for inputs and services can be considered as sustainable for the following reasons:  a.  It is a farmer organization from top to bottom, providing essential services to the farming community. Hence, the acceptance level in the farming community is high.   b.  With renewed focus on financial inclusion, farmer clubs can act as BCs of banks, facilitated through their federations. This will ensure that farmers get both banking services and agricultural inputs and related information at one place.   c.  Production, processing and consumption of certified seed is carried out to meet the requirement of the farmers, creating readymade market locally.  The benefits to the farmers include timely availability of high quality seed at a reasonable cost.   d.  The State Government is channelizing its payments/subsidies under 7-8 schemes through these kiosks making them more popular among the farmers.   e.  The operating margin at the PO level is quite satisfactory. In its first year, it has surpassed the break-even level, even earning a little surplus. The State Government supported the farmers for cultivating seed and the PO for processing the seed.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Replication Of The Model",,,,,195,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The model of the Producer Organization (PO) with federations and farmer clubs is considered sustainable due to its farmer-centric approach and provision of essential services.

361,266,"The demand for quality seed is more than what the farmers could produce at present.  Therefore, there is scope for growth. There is potential for the activity to become viable, even without subsidy.  f.  For the State Government, there is a farmer organization which is able to take care of the input needs of the farmers. State Government can converge some of its agricultural schemes through the PO/ farmer federation and reach the unreached. Agricultural extension services can be provided using this institutional arrangement at a lower cost to a large number of farmers.","Attachment 4: A Case Study On Transformation Of Farmers Clubs To Producer Organization In Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh State,Replication Of The Model",,,,,94,input/md/english/FARMER PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS.pdf,para,,"The demand for quality seed exceeds current production, indicating potential for growth.
