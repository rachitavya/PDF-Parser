19,19,"1.1  The National Development Council (NDC) in its 53rd meeting held on 29th May, 2007 adopted a resolution to launch a Food Security Mission comprising rice, wheat and pulses to increase the annual production of rice by 10 million tonnes, wheat by 8 million tonnes and pulses by 2 million tonnes by the end of the Eleventh Plan (2011-12).  Accordingly, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, 'National Food Security Mission' (NFSM), was launched in October 2007. The Mission met with an overwhelming success and achieved the targeted additional production of rice, wheat and pulses.  The Mission continued during 12th Five Year Plan with new targets of additional production of food grains of 25 million tonnes of food grains comprising of 10 million tonnes rice, 8 million tonnes of wheat, 4 million tonnes of pulses and 3 million tonnes of coarse cereals by the end of 12th Five Year Plan. Considering the experience and feedback received from the States major changes were made in approach, norms of financial assistance and programme implementation strategy which are reflected in the revised operational guidelines. Based on past experience and performance of 12th Plan, it has been decided to continue the programme beyond 12th plan i.e. 2017-18 to 2019-20, which is coterminus with Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) period with new targets to achieve 13 million tonnes of additional foodgrains production comprising of Rice - 5 million tonnes, Wheat- 3 million tonnes, Pulses- 3 million tonnes and Coarse Cereals- 2 million tonnes by 2019-20.  1.2  The National Food Security Mission (NFSM), during the 12th Five Year Plan, had five components (i) NFSM- Rice; (ii) NFSM-Wheat; (iii) NFSM-Pulses; (iv) NFSM- Coarse Cereals; and (v) NFSM-Commercial Crops. During 2017-18, the programme was implemented with components/interventions/cost norms/pattern of assistance of 12th plan.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),Operational Guidelines (Foodgrain Crops) 1.

24,25,"To achieve the above objectives, the Mission would adopt following strategies:   i.  Focus on low productivity and high potential districts including cultivation of food grain crops in rain fed areas.  ii.  Implementation of cropping system centric interventions in a Mission mode approach through active engagement of all the stakeholders at various levels.  iii.  Agro-climatic zone wise planning and cluster approach for crop productivity enhancement.  iv.  Focus on pulse production through utilization of rice fallow, rice bunds and intercropping of pulses with coarse cereals, oilseeds and commercial crops (sugarcane, cotton, jute).   v.  Promotion  and  extension  of improved technologies i.e., seed, integrated  nutrient  management (INM) including micronutrients, soil amendments,  integrated  pest management (IPM), input  use efficiency and resource conservation  technologies along with capacity building of the farmers/extension functionaries.  vi.  Close monitoring of flow of funds to ensure timely reach of interventions to the target beneficiaries.  vii.  Integration of various interventions and targets with the district plan of each identified district.  viii.  Constant monitoring and periodic evaluation by the implementing agencies for assessing the impact of the interventions for a result oriented approach.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),3.

However, the mission has been implemented through State Government at district level in some of the states during 12th Plan.  Such an agency could be the State Agricultural Management & Extension Training Institute (SAMETI) at the State Level and the Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) at the district level. Some States directly transfer the funds through treasury to district level (Joint Director/Deputy Director, Agriculture or equivalent). The agency thus nominated will implement the Mission's programme in the State beyond 12th Plan (2017-18 to 2019-20). The State Government may consider continuation of the same system. 4.2.3 Separate accounts for the scheme would be maintained by the State through Public Financial Management System (PFMS), which is mandatory from April 2018.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),4.2 State Level",,,,,278,input/md/english/NFSM12102018.pdf,para,,

(iii)  Value Chain integration of small producers: Majority of the farmers are small producers who face difficulties in managing high risk involved in farming mainly due to weather aberrations, uneven access to technologies, unreliable input supplies, erratic power supply, inadequate marketing arrangements etc. Forming and strengthening of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) is likely to mitigate at least some of the risks and constraints faced by the farmers. The formation of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) may offer a collective strength for seed production and seed procurement, access to credit and improved technologies, reduce transaction costs, facilitate value addition, tap high value markets etc and enter into partnerships with private entities on more equitable terms. Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) has already demonstrated the benefits of aggregating farmers into FPOs during the XII Plan.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),14.5 Other Initiatives",,,,,300,input/md/english/NFSM12102018.pdf,para,,
115,102,"    State Governments will be required to submit their action plans for FPO  promotion, to be undertaken through SFAC or similar organisations, along with their annual action plans.  Assistance for FPO promotion will be available for a maximum period of three years as per the FPO Process Guidelines of DAC & FW. The Action Plans must specify the commodity, target area and target producers, besides the manner in which value addition will be undertaken during the promotion of FPOs.  The Action Plan should broadly be divided into four areas viz.  (i) Mobilization, training, exposure and capacity building interventions (ii) agriculture based livelihood interventions such as trial and demonstration of Good Agriculture Practices (replacement of varieties, pre-and Post-sowing practices, seed production and dissemination, INM, IPM, etc.) (iii) formation and development of Kissan Producer Company or other institutional form, which will include awareness building, federating, drafting constitution, registration of the company, develop and establish system and procedures related to administration, accounts, HR, develop business plan and implementation, statutory compliance , etc. and (iv) linkage to value chain (marketing).  SFAC will assist the State Governments in drawing up action plans, if required. State Governments will also have the flexibility to undertake FPO promotion through any other Central, State, Civil Society or private in the process Guidelines for FPOs referred to above, will be followed in such sector entity of their choice.  A copy of the FPO Process Guidelines is available on the DAC & FW and SFAC web sites. The component wise financial provisions for one FPO of 1000 farmers under Value Chain Integration of Small and Marginal farmers is  given at **Annexure-VIII.**  (iv) **Assistance to Custom Hiring Centres:** For small land holders, the farm  mechanization by individual farm families is economically not viable.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),14.5 Other Initiatives",,,,,290,input/md/english/NFSM12102018.pdf,para,,
116,102,"Therefore, such farm holders utilize the services of Custom Hiring Centres for the various farm operations. Also, under special cases, community operations of selected farm activities are required to be undertaken within a time frame. In view of this, provision has been made to subsidize cost of hiring machines for farming operations at individual farmer/community level. The machines can be hired from existing Custom Hiring Centres and/or Custom Hiring  Centres to be established under the National Mission on Agricultural Mechanization. The State Governments may submit proposals with subsidy for hiring machines for farm operations not exceeding Rs. 1500/- per hectare. The proposals submitted by the States would be approved by the NFSMEC.  (v)  Marketing support for nutri cereals, millets and pulses: For promoting the production of pulses and millets, it is proposed that marketing support would be provided to growers in form of insurance cover for machines, Dal mill and millet/ nutri cereals processing unit to individual/communities, incentives to processing agencies etc. Assistance will be limited to 50% of the cost of the items. Funds will be allocated to SFAC and similar organizations at Centre/State level against specific proposals approved by NFSM-EC. The support for value addition and marketing in pulses and millets is given **Annexure-VIII** will cover the following areas:-  1. Establishment of mini dal mills by farmers, farmer groups or registered  FPOs (@ Rs. 10.00 lakhs, or 30% of the total cost, whichever is lower,  as one time support)  2.

359,340,"1.1   Millets have high protein, fibre and mineral contents as compared to fine cereals like wheat and rice. Particularly, millet crops are more superior in terms of nutritive value health benefits. Further, these crops have low water requirements being C4 plant, wider adaptability to varied ecology/climate; are environment friendly with low consumption of pesticides, best suited for contingency planning with large stake of small, marginal & tribal farmers. Moreover, use of millets reduces the malnutrition and tackles anemia and micronutrient deficiency commonly found in women and children.   1.2   Millets were earlier being promoted during 2011-12 to 2013-14 under the programme of Initiative for Nutritional Security through Intensive Millets Promotion (INSIMP) - as a sub scheme of RKVY and now merged as component of National Food Security Mission (NFSM) as NFSM-Coarse Cereals from 2014-15. At present, this programme is being implemented in 265 districts of 28 states of the country.  As a follow up of the decision taken by Hon'ble Prime Minister during the meeting held on 18th July, 2017, the Committee under the Chairmanship of Prof. Ramesh Chand, Member, NITI Aayog in respect of ""Introduction of Millets under PDS to provide Nutritional Support"" was held on 13.10.2017 in NITI Aayog. After deliberations, the following decisions were taken for initiating appropriate action by DAC & FW.  a) Millets viz. Jowar, Bajra and Ragi need to be promoted through PDS  across the country to improve nutritional content in diet of masses. Instead of calling them coarse grains, millets should be positioned as nutri-cereals and their benefits need to be popularized amongst masses through sustained and effective campaign  b) Research needs to be done to develop high yielding varieties and also  varieties with longer shelf life.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),Nutri-Cereals 1.

On the basis of recommendations of NITI Aayog, it has been decided to create a Sub Mission on Nutri Cereals covering Jowar, Bajra and Small millets as a component of existing NFSM-Coarse Cereals.  Promotion of millets as sub mission of NFSM will provide support to the farmers, consumers in those areas where these crops are traditionally grown and consumed by rural population. Secondly, the millets are even not consumed in the growing areas due to longer cooking time, difficulty in preparation, lack of value addition, marketing support and change in food habits. After operationalisation of this Sub Mission on Nutri-Cereals, the existing NFSM-Coarse Cereals will be known as NFSM-Coarse Cereals covering Maize & Barley only.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),Nutri-Cereals 1.

368,369,"The Nutri-cereals production can be increased through increase in the crop area or by increasing the productivity of agricultural crops per unit of area. Expansion of area under nutri-cereal crops is limited due to limited availability of    lands and increased demand for lands for non-agricultural purposes. Therefore increase in the productivity of millets remains the most viable option for enhancing the production of Nutri-Cereals in the country. In most of the states, farmers realize lesser yield for the Nutri-Cereal crops as compared to the yield demonstrated by the research institutes. There is, therefore, potential for increasing the productivity by using/promoting the newly released varieties and improved package of practices. Inability of the farmers in ensuring the improved package of practices as demonstrated by the research stations often lead to yield gap. Significant income generation of millets farmers can be done by productivity enhancement of millets through reducing yield gaps in fallows, dry lands and wastelands under millets cultivation.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),5.

398,399,"State Seed Certification Agencies     Seed play the most important role in increasing the productivity of agriculture sector. Introduction of high yielding varieties of rice and wheat during the early sixties played a major role in bringing green revolution in India. Development of the millets seed sector in the country will need introduction of seeds that can resist water stress, are of short duration and other qualities that suit the dryland conditions. Developing HYVs of these crops will significantly add to the development of the dryland agriculture in the country.  In millets, availability of quality seeds is only 30-35% (Seed Replacement Rate) and remaining 65-70% is supplied through informal sector (farm saved seed) whose quality is much below the desired level. In order to increase the availability of quality seeds to farmers, creation of millet seed hubs is necessary and quality seed will help to enhance production by 20-30%.   The seed hubs will be created in states selected under NFSM Nutri-cereals component. The primary objective of these seed hubs is to ensure the availability of location specific HYVs/Hybrids at affordable prices to farmers following generation system of seed multiplication from breeder seed to foundation seed to certified seed.   The seed hubs are managed by SAUs/ Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)/ ICAR  institutes which will be identified by respective state governments. The seed hubs will have primary seed processing along with seed storage facilities. The technical assistance and expenditure if any will be provided to each hub for maintenance and operational aspects of seed production and processing machinery through revolving fund.   Along with these seed hubs, seed producing agencies like NSC/SSCs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes will also undertake foundation/certified seed production and among which authorized by the State they will distribute seed to selected districts. The DFSMEC will finalize the list of beneficiaries in consultation with Village Panchayat.

760,761,"Cotton, Jute and Sugarcane are amongst the main cash crops of India.  These crops are grown in food crops sequences in different agroclimatic conditions. In 12th Five Year Plan, cropping system approach was adopted by including commercial crops like cotton, jute and sugarcane to meet the demand for both food & cash crops under NFSM. The Commercial Crops based cropping system component is continued for the period from 2017- 18 to 2019-20. This would be possible through proper crop rotation, multiple cropping systems, intercropping etc. The commercial crop based cropping system linked with food crops are given in **Annexure-IX**.  The Commercial Crops component of NFSM wouldbe implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) through State Department of Agriculture (SDA), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), etc.The Crop Development Directorates (CDD's) i.e Directorate of Cotton Development (DOCD), Nagpur, Directorate of Jute Development (DOJD), Kolkata and Directorate of Sugarcane Development (DOSD), Lucknow will act as nodal office of respective commercial crop, besides, their participation for dissemination of technology of mandated crops.  The main objectives of including commercial crop based cropping system are i) to utilize vacant inter-row space of Commercial Crops by growing oilseeds, pulses and food crops, etc ii) to generate higher net returns and cultivable land utilization index as compare to mono-cropping iii) to increase the soil fertility status by adopting proper crop rotation with commercial crops iv) to implement IPM strategies and reduce pest load through cropping system approach v) to demonstrate latest technologies of crop utilization, intercropping, seed production; and vi) to implement need based interventions of recent priorities in cotton, jute and sugarcane crop.","Part-Ii National Food Security Mission-Commercial Crops (Nfsm-Cc),******** 1.

864,838,"1.1 Vegetable Oil Scenario: Domestic consumption of edible oils has increased  substantially over the years and has touched the level of more than 25.41 million tonnes in 2016-17 (Prov.), which is likely to increase further with enhancement in per capita income and population. The production of domestic edible oils (10.75 million tonnes in 2016-17 Prov.) has not been able to keep pace with the growth in consumption and the gap between production and consumption is being met through imports of 15.31 million tonnes with >Rs. 73048 crores (2016-17 Prov.).     1.2 Primary sources of vegetable oil:Nine oilseeds are the primary source of vegetable oils  in the country, which are largely grown under rainfed condition (70%) over an area of  about 26 million ha. Among these, soybean (34%), groundnut (27%), rapeseed & mustard (27%) contribute more than 88% of total oilseeds production and >80% of vegetable oils with major share of mustard (35%), soybean (23%) and groundnut (25%). Primary  source are producing 7.31 million tonnes of oils (2016-17)    1.3 Secondary sources of vegetable oil: In addition to nine oilseeds, 3.45 million tonnes of  vegetable oil is being harnessed from secondary sources like cottonseed, rice bran, coconut, Tree Borne Oilseeds (TBOs) and Oil palm during 2016-17.     1.4 Oilseeds production scenario: The production and yield of oilseeds during 11th plan  was 28.93 million tonnes and 1082 kg/ha which is increased to 29.71 million tonnes and 1122 kg/ha respectively during 12th plan period. The year-wise area, production and productivity of oilseeds during last five years are given below.","Part-Ii National Food Security Mission-Commercial Crops (Nfsm-Cc),Revamped Nfsm - Oilseeds & Oilpalm 1 Introduction",,,,,253,input/md/english/NFSM12102018.pdf,para,,

Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra are the major oilseed growing states which contribute 76% production and 72% area coverage in the country but the productivity is less as compared to world average and Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs) yield indicate further scope of improvement.  1.5 Scenario of Oil Palm Cultivation:Oil Palm is a highest vegetable oil yielding perennial  crop than that of other oil seed crops. With quality planting material, irrigation and proper management, oil palm could produce 20-25 ton Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFBs) and 4-5 tonnes palm oil per ha on attaining the age of 8-9 years in comparison to maximum of 1 tonne oil per ha from rape seed & mustard In addition, oil palm has advantage of long life span of about 30 years. A substantial portion of our requirement of edible oil is met through import of palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia. Any disruption in the supply of palm oil from these countries may place India in a very odd condition. More than 70% of our total vegetable oil import is palm oil.    An area of 19.33 lakh hectares has been identified in 18 states of the country as suitable for oil palm cultivation.","Part-Ii National Food Security Mission-Commercial Crops (Nfsm-Cc),Revamped Nfsm - Oilseeds & Oilpalm 1 Introduction",,,,,280,input/md/english/NFSM12102018.pdf,para,,
866,838,"Oil palm cultivation started during 1975-76 in India has shown good impact in terms of area coverage and yield of FFBs of oil palm. So far, an area of 3.00 lakh ha has been covered under oil palm through various programmes under erstwhile scheme NMOOP. The FFBs yields obtained by progressive farmers of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, under optimum cultural and irrigated conditions, are between 20 and 25 tonnes per ha from fourth year onwards. The highest yield of 30-35 tonnes FFB ha /yr during the seventh year was also recorded in Andhra Pradesh.    1.6 Tree Borne Oilseeds (TBOs):The extraction of oils from TBOs has been a long tradition  in India. The forest dwellers and tribal people have been extracting oils from TBOs for edible, medicinal and other uses. Sal, mahua, simarouba, kokum, olive and cheura are being used as a source of edible fat/ oil.  Besides, edible grade fat of sal, cheura, mango kernel and kokum are exported for confectionary purposes. In addition, karanja, jatropha, neem, jojoba, wild apricot, walnut and tung etc. are being used as a source of non-edible / industrial oil. The Contribution of TBOs in vegetable oil is about 1.50 lakh tonnes.    1.7 Merger of NMOOP under NFSM:  National Mission on Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NMOOP)  was launched in 2014-15 and continued upto 2017-18 to augment the availability of vegetable oils and to reduce the import of edible oils by increasing the production and  productivity of oilseeds and area expansion of oil palm. The EFC meeting for continuation of Umbrella Scheme 'Krishonnati Yojana' was held on 29.11.2017 under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. It has been decided for merger/ conversions or linkage of Schemes/ sub-Schemes/ programmes,  etc.","Part-Ii National Food Security Mission-Commercial Crops (Nfsm-Cc),Revamped Nfsm - Oilseeds & Oilpalm 1 Introduction",,,,,287,input/md/english/NFSM12102018.pdf,para,,

Land being a limiting factor area expansion under any agricultural crop will depend on economic viability of the crop. Front line demonstration conducted by ICAR indicates an average yield gap of 40% - 50% in oilseeds with adoption of available varieties / technologies. Therefore major emphasis will be laid on productivity improvement of various oilseed crops. The broad strategies are suggested as under:  ïƒ˜ Increasing Seed Replacement Ratio (SRR) with focus on varietal replacement;  increasing irrigation coverage under oilseeds; diversification of area from low yielding cereals crops  to oilseeds crops; inter-cropping of oilseeds with cereals/ pulses/ sugarcane.  ïƒ˜ Productivity improvement by adoption of proven and climatic resilient  technologies  like Ridge-Furrow/Broad-Bed-Furrow, water saving devices (sprinklers/rain gun), zero tillage, inter-cropping, relay cropping, strategic application of micro-nutrient and soil ameliorants.  ïƒ˜ Area expansion under oilseeds through diversification of low yielding food grain, use  of rice fallows area, and inter-cropping of oilseed crops with pulses and coarse cereals and promotion of non-traditional states.  ïƒ˜  Popularisation of frontier technologies  Oilseeds","Part-Ii National Food Security Mission-Commercial Crops (Nfsm-Cc),3.
