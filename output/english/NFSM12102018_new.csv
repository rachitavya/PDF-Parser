7,8,"1.1  The National Development Council (NDC) in its 53rd meeting held on 29th May, 2007 adopted a resolution to launch a Food Security Mission comprising rice, wheat and pulses to increase the annual production of rice by 10 million tonnes, wheat by 8 million tonnes and pulses by 2 million tonnes by the end of the Eleventh Plan (2011-12).  Accordingly, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, 'National Food Security Mission' (NFSM), was launched in October 2007. The Mission met with an overwhelming success and achieved the targeted additional production of rice, wheat and pulses.  The Mission continued during 12th Five Year Plan with new targets of additional production of food grains of 25 million tonnes of food grains comprising of 10 million tonnes rice, 8 million tonnes of wheat, 4 million tonnes of pulses and 3 million tonnes of coarse cereals by the end of 12th Five Year Plan. Considering the experience and feedback received from the States major changes were made in approach, norms of financial assistance and programme implementation strategy which are reflected in the revised operational guidelines.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),Operational Guidelines (Foodgrain Crops) 1.

During the 12th Five Year Plan, new targets were set for additional production of food grains, with major changes made in approach, financial assistance norms, and program implementation strategy based on state feedback and experience. The revised operational guidelines reflect these changes and aim to further enhance the mission's effectiveness. The National Development Council adopted a resolution to launch the Food Security Mission to increase the annual production of rice, wheat, and pulses by specific amounts by the end of the Eleventh Plan. The Centrally Sponsored Scheme, NFSM, was launched in October 2007 and has continued to evolve and adapt to achieve its objectives."

During 2017-18, the programme was implemented with components/interventions/cost norms/pattern of assistance of 12th plan. On the basis of EFC recommendations which was held on 29.11.2017, from the years 2018-19 and 2019-20, NMOOP and Seed Village Programme are now a part of NFSM and thus NFSM will have **eight** components viz. (i) NFSM- Rice; **(ii)** NFSM-Wheat; **(iii)** NFSM-Pulses; **(iv)** NFSM-Coarse Cereals (Maize, Barley), (v) NFSM-Sub Mission on Nutri Cereals; **(vi)** NFSM-Commercial Crops; **(vii)** NFSM- Oilseeds and Oilpalm; and **(viii)** NFSM-Seed Village Programme.

Instead of calling them coarse grains, millets should be positioned as nutri-cereals and their benefits need to be popularized amongst masses through sustained and effective campaign  b) Research needs to be done to develop high yielding varieties and also  varieties with longer shelf life. It may also be examined whether nutricereals can be promoted as a sub-mission under the National Food Security Mission.  On the basis of recommendations of NITI Aayog, it has been decided to create a Sub Mission on Nutri Cereals covering Jowar, Bajra and Small millets as a component of existing NFSM-Coarse Cereals.  Promotion of millets as sub mission of NFSM will provide support to the farmers, consumers in those areas where these crops are traditionally grown and consumed by rural population.

216,289,"The Nutri-cereals production can be increased through increase in the crop area or by increasing the productivity of agricultural crops per unit of area. Expansion of area under nutri-cereal crops is limited due to limited availability of    lands and increased demand for lands for non-agricultural purposes. Therefore increase in the productivity of millets remains the most viable option for enhancing the production of Nutri-Cereals in the country. In most of the states, farmers realize lesser yield for the Nutri-Cereal crops as compared to the yield demonstrated by the research institutes. There is, therefore, potential for increasing the productivity by using/promoting the newly released varieties and improved package of practices. Inability of the farmers in ensuring the improved package of practices as demonstrated by the research stations often lead to yield gap. Significant income generation of millets farmers can be done by productivity enhancement of millets through reducing yield gaps in fallows, dry lands and wastelands under millets cultivation.","(Foodgrain Crops) Re-Vamped National Food Security Mission (Nfsm),5.

However, limited availability of land for agriculture and increased demand for non-agricultural purposes restricts the expansion of crop area. Therefore, enhancing the productivity of millets is the most viable option. Farmers in most states achieve lower yields for Nutri-Cereal crops compared to research institute demonstrations, indicating potential for productivity improvement through new varieties and practices. Inadequate adoption of improved practices by farmers leads to yield gaps, but addressing this can significantly increase income for millet farmers.

444,685,"Retting is the most important factor determining the quality of fibre.   The whole retting technology is being practiced in India for which large quantity of water is required. CRIJAF has developed two new retting technologies, namely, mechano-microbial retting and in-situ retting with microbial consortium and NIRJAFT has developed two technologies, namely, chemical retting and dry retting. In order to reduce the bulk of the crop to be retted vis-à-vis the requirement of water, the concept of ribbon retting has been advanced. Accordingly, FLDs on newly developed retting technologies will be undertaken by CRIJAF, NIRJAFT, SDA, SAUs, KVKs, ICAR institutes.

The plan outlines the financial assistance and physical targets for each intervention, with specific details for each year of the project. It also specifies the funding pattern for interventions, such as 50 to 70% funding from PMKSY for diesel/electric pump sets. Additionally, it provides the unit of measurement for each intervention, such as hectares for planting material and establishment/maintenance of seed garden, and numbers for diesel/electric pump sets and construction of vermi compost unit."

The Flexi Fund may cover activities such as organizing exposure visits, distribution of pre-processing, processing and oil extraction equipment, concurrent/mid-term and end of the Plan period evaluation by an independent agency, and any other state-specific local initiatives crucial for effective implementation of NFSM-TBOs. The subsidy assistance for installation of pre-processing equipments and oil expeller is available on sharing between Central and State. The state needs to provide proper justification about processing/oil extraction units to avail the assistance. State Government may include activities under Flexi Fund which are not covered as an intervention under the programme NFSM-TBOs within 10% of the total allocation."
