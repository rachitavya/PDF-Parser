11,"The scheme aims to supplement the financial needs of all landholding farmers' families in procuring various inputs to ensure proper crop health and appropriate yields, commensurate with the anticipated farm income as well as for domestic needs. Under the Scheme an amount of Rs.6000/- per year is released by the Central Government online directly into the bank accounts of the eligible farmers under Direct Benefit Transfer mode, subject to certain exclusions. 3.  Definition of farmer's family    A landholder farmer's family is defined as ""a family comprising of husband, wife and minor children who owns cultivable land as per land records of the concerned State/UT"".  The existing land-ownership system will be used for identification of beneficiaries for calculation of benefit. 4  Exclusions 4.1  The following categories of beneficiaries of higher economic status shall not be  eligible for benefit under the scheme: (a)  All Institutional Land holders; and   (b)  Farmer families in which one or more of its members belong to following categories :  i) Former and present holders of constitutional posts    ii) Former and present Ministers / State Ministers and former / present  Members of  Lok Sabha / Rajya Sabha / State Legislative Assemblies / State Legislative Councils, former and present Mayors of Municipal Corporations, former and present Chairpersons of District Panchayats.  iii) All serving or retired officers and employees of Central / State Government  Ministries / Offices / Departments and their field units, Central or State PSEs and Attached offices / Autonomous Institutions under Government as well as regular  employees of the Local Bodies (Excluding Multi Tasking Staff / Class IV / Group D employees)    iv) All superannuated / retired pensioners whose monthly pension is Rs.10,000/- or  more *(Excluding Multi Tasking Staff / Class IV / Group D employees)*  v) All Persons who paid Income Tax in last assessment year.    vi) Professionals like Doctors, Engineers, Lawyers, Chartered Accountants, and  Architects registered with Professional bodies and carrying out profession by undertaking practices.

13,"5.1  The benefit shall be paid to only those farmers' families whose names are entered into the land records. Exception has, however, been made for North-East States and Jharkhand in this regard. 5.2  The cut-off date for determination of eligibility of beneficiaries under the scheme shall be 01.02.2019 and no changes thereafter shall be considered for eligibility of benefit under the scheme for next 5 years. However, this date is not applicable when transfer of ownership of cultivable land takes place on account of succession due to death. 5.3  Benefit will be allowed in those cases where transfer of ownership of cultivable land takes place on account of succession due to death of the landowner. However, those eligible farmers whose names have been entered in the land record after 01.12.2018 till 01.02.2019 shall be eligible for the benefits from the date of entry of land rights in the land records. In such cases where, transfer of ownership of cultivable land has happened due to any reason which could be purchase, succession, will, gift, etc., between 01.12.2018 and 31.01.2019, the installment pertaining to the 4-monthly period / trimester December, 2018 - March, 2019 during the financial year (2018-19) shall be proportionate amount from date of transfer till 31.03.2019 with respect to the 4 months period. 5.3.1 In cases where the land records have not been updated for rights accruing due to succession on account of the death of land owners before 01.12.2018, such updation of land records may be done by the States in a time bound manner.  The successors    whose names are entered in land records for rights accrued as aforementioned shall be eligible subject to fulfilment of other conditions of the Scheme and the exclusion clauses.  5.3.2 Clause 5.3 of the Operational Guidelines, which provides for proportionate amount of financial benefit under the scheme to be transferred in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries in cases involving transfer of ownership between 01.12.2018 to 31.01.2019, shall remain applicable to the cases of succession as well which is clear from the wording of the said clause. 5.3.3 Subsequent to 01.02.2019, there could be change in ownership due to the following reasons:-   i)  Transfer of ownership due to inheritance resulting out of death of the land  owner.  In such cases the family of the successors would be entitled to the  benefits, if otherwise eligible as per scheme guidelines.  ii)  In cases of cultivable land transferred to other persons through Sale Deed,  Partition Deed, Gift Deed, etc., the transferee will not be eligible under the Scheme as he / she was not the land owner as on 01.02.2019.  However, in such cases even the transferor of the land will become ineligible if the family of the transferor does not have any cultivable land subsequent to such a transfer.   5.3.4 The State Governments have to put in place the administrative mechanism based on their existing land revenue administrative regime to take care of formulations. There should be clear cut responsibility entrusted to the officials responsible for undertaking mutation of land records.   i)  In case of correction of land record for recording land ownership accrued  due to inheritance before 01.12.2018 then the eligibility of the family under the scheme shall be properly determined as per the conditions of the scheme. The procedure for determining the eligibility as per the exclusion clauses shall remain as prescribed.  ii)  In case of transfer of land ownership due to inheritance, reassessing the  eligibility of the family under PM-KISAN -  If the family is no longer eligible, then the same have to be updated in the PM-KISAN portal so that the benefits can be discontinued subsequently.  In case of family of the deceased land owner is still eligible (where spouse or the minor children are having cultivable land and eligible as per guidelines), the details of the new beneficiary alongwith other details with the fresh self-declarations have to be provided to the concerned authorities for inclusion / modifications so that the benefit to the survivors of the family can continue.  iii)  Subsequent to inheritance if the families of the inheritors also become  freshly eligible under PM-Kisan then all the details of the freshly eligible families have to be incorporated in the database so that benefits start accruing to such families from the date when inheritance became operational.  iv)  In case of transfer of cultivable land for reasons other than death after  01.02.2019, the officials have to reassess the eligibility of the transferor  and decide whether the benefits have to be stopped or not and intimate the authorities so that the PM-KISAN portal can be updated.  Transferees  are not entitled for any benefits under PM-KISAN in such cases.   5.4  The beneficiaries, whose names are uploaded on PM-Kisan Portal by the State /  UT Government in a particular 4-month period / trimester, shall be entitled to receive benefit for that trimester and for further installments pertaining to the subsequent trimesters for that financial year. 5.5  In some of the North Eastern States, the land ownership rights are community based and it might not be possible to assess the quantum of land holder farmers. In such States an alternate implementation mechanism for eligibility of the farmers will be developed and approved by the Committee of Union Ministers of Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), the Ministry of Rural Development (Department of Land Resources), the Union Agriculture Minister and the concerned State Chief Ministers or their Ministerial representatives, based on the proposal by the concerned North Eastern States. 5.5.1 For identification of *bona fide* beneficiary under PM-Kisan Scheme in Manipur, the following proposal of Government of Manipur was considered and approved by the Committee: ""The certificate issued by the Village authority, namely, the Chairman/Chief, authorizing any tribal family to cultivate a piece of land, may be accepted. Such certification of village Chairman/Chief shall be authenticated by the concerned sub-divisional officers. All the exclusions under the Operational Guidelines will be applicable."" 5.5.2 For identification of *bona fide* beneficiary under PM-Kisan Scheme in Nagaland, the following procedure was approved by the Committee:  1) In case of community owned cultivable land in the state of Nagaland which is  under permanent cultivation, for identification of beneficiaries under PM-KISAN, the certificate issued by the village council/authority/village chieftan  regarding land holding, duly verified by the administrative head of the circle/sub-division and countersigned by the Deputy Commissioner of the District shall suffice subject to  the exclusions under the operational guidelines.    2) In case of cultivable land in the State of Nagaland which is categorised as Jhum  land as per definition under Section–2(7) of the Nagaland Jhum Land Act, 1970 and which is owned by the community/clan/village council/village chieftan, the identification of beneficiaries under PM-Kisan scheme, shall be on the basis of certification of land holding by the village council/chief/head of the village, duly verified by the administrative head of the circle/sub division and countersigned by the Deputy Commissioner of the District. Provided that the name of the beneficiary is included in the state of Nagaland's Agriculture Census of 2015-16. This proviso shall not be applicable in cases of succession and family partition.  The list of such beneficiaries shall be subject to the exclusions under the operational guidelines.  5.6  For identification of *bona fide* beneficiary under PM-Kisan Scheme in Jharkhand, the following proposal of Government of Jharkhand was considered and approved by the Committee: ""The farmer will be asked to submit 'Vanshavali (Lineage)' linked to the entry of land record comprising his \ her ancestor's name giving a chart of successor. This lineage chart shall be submitted before the Gram Sabha for calling objections. After approval of the Gram Sabha, the village level \ circle level revenue officials will verify and authenticate the Vanshawali and possession of holding. This authenticated list of farmers after due verification of succession chart shall be countersigned by the District level revenue authority. Farmers' names, subject to the exclusion criterion after following the aforementioned process, shall be uploaded on the PM-Kisan portal along with other required details for this disbursement of benefit under the scheme.""",,,"Department Of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers' Welfare (Dac&Fw),5.

15,"6.1  The States shall prepare database of eligible beneficiary land holder farmer families in the villages capturing the Name, Age, Gender, Category (SC/ST), Aadhaar Number, Bank Account Number and the Mobile Number of the beneficiaries. Responsibility of identifying the land holder farmer family eligible for benefit under the scheme shall be of the State / UT Government. In case of beneficiaries in States of Assam, Meghalaya, J&K where Aadhaar number has not been issued to most of the citizens, Aadhaar number shall be collected for those beneficiaries where it is available and for others alternate prescribed documents such as Driving Licence, Voters' ID Card, NREGA Job Card, or any other identification documents issued by Central / State / UT Governments or their authorities, etc. can be collected for identity verification purposes. These three States have been exempted from the requirement of Aadhaar number till 31.3.2021. In the meantime these States will complete Aadhaar enrolment. States / UTs shall ensure that there is no duplication of the payment transferred to eligible families. Speedy reconciliation in case of wrong / incomplete bank details of the beneficiary should be ensured. 6.2   For the purpose of exclusion States have to take a self-declaration from the beneficiaries as detailed in par 4.2 above. In the said self-declaration taken by the States / UT Governments an undertaking should also be included wherein the consent of the beneficiaries should be taken for using the Aadhaar number for verification of his eligibility for the scheme with the concerned agencies.  This consent of the beneficiary should be ""to agree that the department responsible for implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana in Union Government or the State Government / Union Territory Administration can use the beneficiary Aadhaar number and other information provided in the declaration to verify the eligibility of the beneficiary for scheme as per extant scheme guidelines with the concerned agencies"". 6.3  The existing land-ownership system in the concerned State / UT will be used for identification of beneficiaries. Accordingly, it is of utmost importance that the land records are clear and updated. Further, State / UT Governments would also expedite    the progress of digitization of the land records and linking the same with Aadhaar as well as bank details of the beneficiaries. 6.4  The lists of eligible beneficiaries would be published at the village level. Farmers'  families who are eligible but have been excluded should be provided an opportunity to represent their case.",,,"Department Of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers' Welfare (Dac&Fw),6.

For transfer of the financial benefits to the eligible farmers, Aadhaar number shall be collected for all beneficiaries, since payment of all installments pertaining to the trimester December, 2019 - March, 2020 onwards shall be done only on the basis of Aadhaar seeded data base. However, exemption has been to the States of Assam, Meghalaya and Jammu & Kashmir from the requirement of Aadhaar number and Aadhaar seeded database under the scheme till 31.3.2021. In the meantime these States will complete Aadhaar enrolment so that subsequent installments are released on the basis of Aadhaar seeded data only. States / UTs shall ensure that there is no duplication of the payment transferred to eligible families. 10.3 The funds pertaining to income support benefit as well as administrative charges shall be released from Government of India to the States' designated account / mechanism.  The benefit shall be transferred by Government of India to the beneficiaries through a mechanism wherein district wise beneficiaries' lists shall be certified and uploaded by the States / UTs and the funds will be electronically transferred via State Notional Account [similar to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS)] to the beneficiaries' bank accounts on the basis of their account numbers and IFSC codes. However, where the states verify that Aadhaar linked accounts are not the loan accounts of beneficiaries, the Aadhaar linked payment system can be adopted. However, from the December, 2019 - March, 2020 trimester onwards the States shall have to ensure Aadhaar linked bank accounts of the beneficiaries, except in case of Assam, Meghalaya and Jammu & Kashmir, which have been given exemption till the 31st March, 2021. For ease of implementation the States may consider assigning the job of sponsoring bank for the scheme to the same bank being used by concerned State for MGNREGS. 10.4 The funds pertaining to income support benefit as well as administrative charges shall be released from Government of India to the State designated account /  mechanism. Detailed modalities for transfer of funds are as under: (a)  The amount due to the beneficiaries under the scheme is to be paid directly into their bank accounts through the mechanism of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The amount will flow to the accounts of the beneficiaries held in destination banks, through the accredited bank of DAC&FW and sponsoring banks of the States /UTs, using PFMS portal. The destination bank can be a Schedule Bank, Post office, Rural Bank, Cooperative Bank or any other Financial Institution.
