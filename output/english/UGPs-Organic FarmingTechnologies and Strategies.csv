1,"Organic Farming : Technologies and Strategies (2016) : 129-147 Editor : B. Gangwar and N. K. Jat Today & Tomorrow's Printes and Publishers, New Delhi - 110 002, IndiaICAR-Indian Institute of Farming systems Research, Modipuram, Meerut (UP)- 250 110 In India organic farming has been practiced since thousands of years. The great Indian civilization thrived on organic farming and it has been practiced in Indian agriculture since the Vedic period. The traditional Indian agriculture was completely organic though it was not termed so. The techniques used for ploughing the field, sowing the seeds, use of fertilizers; everything had organic sensibility. Indian farmers have an inherent understanding of how to work closely with the nature, because only 30% of India's total cultivable area is covered with fertilizers because of assured irrigation and the balance 70% of arable land is mainly rainfed with little or zero use of fertilizer."," Sudhir Kumar3 And Krishna Kumar4,7.

2,"Currently Indian agriculture is passing through a very critical phase.On the one hand, it is bearing the responsibility of providing national as well as household food and nutritional security to its teeming millions in a scenario of plateau of genetic potential in all major crops and little improvement in productivity of vast tracts of rainfed/dryland areas constituting approximately 44.2% of net cultivated area.  Whereas, on the other hand, wide-spread occurrence of ill-effects of Green Revolution Technologies (GRTs) in all intensively cultivated irrigated areas, a backbone to national food security, is threatening the very sustainability of the agricultural production system and national food security. Thirdly, it has to share local as well as global responsibility to ensure environmental safety for human kind.","7. Upper Gangetic Plains: Uttar Pradesh N. K. Jat1, R. S.

3,"In this scenario, now the farmers are gradually shifting back to organic farming. India has some natural advantages over other countries regarding utility of organic farming. India has vast cultivated area which has remained free of chemical contamination. The large agricultural land is rainfed with zero or very less use of synthetic fertilizers thus can be converted to organic farming easily. Organic farming is useful for small farmers as it does not demand extensive inputs. The other reason behind the shift to organic farming is growing demand of organic food in domestic as well as international market.","7. Upper Gangetic Plains: Uttar Pradesh N. K. Jat1, R. S. Yadav2, Sudhir Kumar3 And Krishna Kumar4",,,,,97,input/md/english\UGPs-Organic FarmingTechnologies and Strategies.pdf,para,,
4,"Organic farming is an integrated system that benefits land, landholder and environment as well. It involves local human, natural resources and processes with respect to carrying capacity of ecology. By reducing dependence on chemical or synthetic inputs and creating more balanced nutrient and energy flow, it strengthens ecosystem resilience, increases food security and generates additional income for cultivators. Organic farming responds positively to all sustainable agriculture and rural development objectives and helps in retaining soil fertility to improve crop production and socio-economic conditions of the farmers.","7.

Vermicompost @ 4.0 t/ ha is to be top dressed before second irrigation. Biofertilizers like *Azotobactor* (nitrogen fixer) and Phosphorus Solublizing Bacteria (PSB) each of are added @10 kg/ha in soil after final land preparation. ï‚· During the whole growing season, 10-11 irrigations will be sufficient for raising a successful crop of okra.  ï‚· Depending upon the severity of weeds, weeds are managed by 2-3 manual weedings. ï‚· For plant protection, growing of resistant varieties and spraying of neem based products can be effective.",Okra,,,,,142,input/md/english\UGPs-Organic FarmingTechnologies and Strategies.pdf,para,,
45,"ï‚· Mustard can be sown optimally up to second week of October. Optimum seed rate for sowing mustard whould be 4 kg/ha. Organically certified seed should be preferred for sowing on ridges made 45 cm apart keeping plant to plant spacing of 10 cm. ï‚· For nutrient management apply well rotten FYM @ 6.0 t/ha in soil at least 20 days before sowing. Vermicompost @ 2.0 t/ ha is to be top dressed before second irrigation. Biofertilizers like Azotobactor (nitrogen fixer) and Phosphorus Solublizing Bacteria (PSB) each of are added @10 kg/ha in soil after final land preparation. ï‚· Including pre-sowing irrigation, three irrigations are sufficient for raising mustard. ï‚· Mustard is a smothering crop for weeds. However, early flush of weeds can be easily managed by one manual weeding. ï‚· As plant protection measures, early/timely sowing of mustard to avoid white rust and sprayingneem based insecticides for mustard aphid are quite effective.",Mustard,,,,,153,input/md/english\UGPs-Organic FarmingTechnologies and Strategies.pdf,para,,
46,"In the backdrop of various reported benefits, there is a greater need to undertake basic and applied research on organic farming. The inputs from agronomists, soil scientists, microbiologists, plant pathologists, entomologists and environmentalists would be highly critical.  Some identified research thrusts are as follows-",Future Research Thrust,,,,,44,input/md/english\UGPs-Organic FarmingTechnologies and Strategies.pdf,para,,
47,"ï‚· Developing innovative crop management practices and quantify detailed nutrient budgets and soil quality improvement indicators (carbon sequestration, dehydrogenase activity, microbial biomass C and N) in major organic-based cropping systems. ï‚· Understanding nutrient release pattern of different organic sources alone and in combination and developing relationship between the crop nutrient demand and supply dynamics. ï‚· Screening of crop varieties suitable for growing under organic management. ï‚· Development and assessment of bio-agents and bio-pesticide for effective control of inset, pest and diseases of organic-based cropping systems. ï‚· Working out the quality, nature and extent of locally available organic manurial resources and the extent that they could replace the chemical fertilizers. ï‚· Evaluation of the sustained returns on long term basis through combinations of organic and inorganic sources in different soil types, crops and cropping systems. ï‚· Developing simple and reliable techniques to measure and monitor the dynamic interrelationship amongst nutrient management, systems, production and soil water. ï‚· The critical values of soil organic matter that can support the sustainable crop production under organic management have to be worked out. ï‚· Complementary cropping systems including intercropping deserve to be perfected under integrated organic farming systems.",Future Research Thrust,,,,,193,input/md/english\UGPs-Organic FarmingTechnologies and Strategies.pdf,para,,
48,"The adverse effects of overuse of Green Revolution Technologies have appeared in the form of natural resource degradation which resulted in posing threat to agricultural sustainability and environmental sustainability. Hence, the environmentalists are resorting to promotion of organic farming and present it as a panacea to all the ills of modern farming. Besides, the continuously increasing demand for organic foods has to be met by growing crops under organic farming. Organic agriculture has made credible impact during the past one decade and growing exponentially in India and world over. Among other areas, the Upper Gangetic Plains of India having a fertile soils and irrigation facilities have lot of potential for promotion of organic farming. Keeping the potentials in mind, farmers have started practicing organic farming but at the same time they are facing several constraints. Moreover, under the back drop of the parallel growth of organic farming in the country, there is a need for institutional strengthening to carryout research, education and extension for promoting organic farming in the region. As organic farming is a dynamic practice, research should continuously focus on emerging issues of organic cultivation and bring in improvement in package of practices for important crops.",Conclusion,,,,,198,input/md/english\UGPs-Organic FarmingTechnologies and Strategies.pdf,para,,
