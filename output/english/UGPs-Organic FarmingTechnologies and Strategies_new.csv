1,1,"ICAR-Indian Institute of Farming systems Research, Modipuram, Meerut (UP)- 250 110 In India organic farming has been practiced since thousands of years. The great Indian civilization thrived on organic farming and it has been practiced in Indian agriculture since the Vedic period. The traditional Indian agriculture was completely organic though it was not termed so. The techniques used for ploughing the field, sowing the seeds, use of fertilizers; everything had organic sensibility. Indian farmers have an inherent understanding of how to work closely with the nature, because only 30% of India's total cultivable area is covered with fertilizers because of assured irrigation and the balance 70% of arable land is mainly rainfed with little or zero use of fertilizer. Currently Indian agriculture is passing through a very critical phase. On the one hand, it is bearing the responsibility of providing national as well as household food and nutritional security to its teeming millions in a scenario of plateau of genetic potential in all major crops and little improvement in productivity of vast tracts of rainfed/dryland areas constituting approximately 44.2% of net cultivated area.","7. Upper Gangetic Plains: Uttar Pradesh N. K. Jat1, R. S. Yadav2, Sudhir Kumar3 And Krishna Kumar4",,,,,183,input/md/english/UGPs-Organic FarmingTechnologies and Strategies.pdf,para,,"Organic farming has been a part of Indian agriculture since ancient times, with traditional techniques reflecting an organic sensibility. While only 30% of India's cultivable area uses fertilizers due to assured irrigation, the remaining 70% of arable land is mainly rainfed with minimal fertilizer use. Indian agriculture is currently facing challenges in terms of plateaued genetic potential in major crops and limited productivity in rainfed/dryland areas, which make up about 44.2% of the net cultivated area. The responsibility of providing national and household food security adds to the critical phase that Indian agriculture is going through. The Indian civilization has a rich history of thriving on organic farming, and the techniques used for ploughing, sowing, and fertilizing have always had organic sensibility."
2,1," Whereas, on the other hand, wide-spread occurrence of ill-effects of Green Revolution Technologies (GRTs) in all intensively cultivated irrigated areas, a backbone to national food security, is threatening the very sustainability of the agricultural production system and national food security. Thirdly, it has to share local as well as global responsibility to ensure environmental safety for human kind. In this scenario, now the farmers are gradually shifting back to organic farming. India has some natural advantages over other countries regarding utility of organic farming. India has vast cultivated area which has remained free of chemical contamination. The large agricultural land is rainfed with zero or very less use of synthetic fertilizers thus can be converted to organic farming easily. Organic farming is useful for small farmers as it does not demand extensive inputs. The other reason behind the shift to organic farming is growing demand of organic food in domestic as well as international market. Organic farming is an integrated system that benefits land, landholder and environment as well. It involves local human, natural resources and processes with respect to carrying capacity of ecology.","7. Upper Gangetic Plains: Uttar Pradesh N. K. Jat1, R. S.

For Basmati rice, wheat, coarse rice, maize (grain and cobs), and other crops, the yield is significantly different across the three farming methods.

12,14,"Source: Annual Report NPOF, Modipuram, 2012-13. Among cropping systems, maize (grain)-potato-okra system recorded maximum total productivity in terms of basmati rice equivalent yield (BREY)(317.0 q/ha) followed by maize (green cobs) - mustard + radish cropping system (109.7 q/ha). On mean basis, the integrated nutrient management produced noticeable higher BREY as compared to organic and inorganic means of nutrient supply(Fig. 1). The economic analysis of different cropping systems (Fig. 2) across the nutrient management practices reveals that highest net returns (Rs. 177297/ha) were recorded under organic nutrient supply. Irrespective of nutrient management options, CS3 (Maize (grain)-potato-okra) recorded the highest system net returns. Data on soil studies (0â€“45 cm soil depth) under different cropping systems and nutrient management practices (Table 3) reveals that across different cropping systems, SOC and available N, P and K in the soil under different management practices were recorded higher under organic followed by integrated and inorganic nutrient supply.

It is evident from the mean data of soil properties (0-45 cm depth) that there was no significant effect of cropping systems and pest management practice on the SOC and availability of N, P and K into soil. However, the available N, P, K and SOC in the soil were significantly increased with green manuring in comparison to summer ploughing(Table 8). Among the cropping systems, the basmati rice-chickpea cropping system registered higher net returns than basmati rice-mustard system. Irrespective of cropping systems, green manuringnoted better net returns and B:C ratio as compared to summer ploughing. Treating the crops with bio pesticides has indicated much net higher returns than untreated plots (Table 9).",3. Disease-Pest Management Options In Organic Systems,,,,,120,input/md/english/UGPs-Organic FarmingTechnologies and Strategies.pdf,para,,"The study found that there was no significant impact of cropping systems and pest management practices on soil properties, but green manuring led to increased availability of nutrients and organic carbon in the soil. The basmati rice-chickpea cropping system showed higher net returns compared to the basmati rice-mustard system. Additionally, green manuring resulted in better net returns and benefit-cost ratio compared to summer ploughing. Treating crops with biopesticides resulted in higher net returns than untreated plots."
